This is a movie whose actual quality has been exceeded by its hype--though NOT because the producers or actors hyped it (like the typical overblown and over-hyped Hollywood film). In fact, when it was released it was not particularly successful (especially compared to other Frank Capra flicks).<br/><br/>No, instead it reached legendary status for TWO reasons alone. It was a public domain video (hence NO ROYALTIES REQUIRED FOR SHOWING IT) AND its setting for the movie's conclusion was the holiday season. These two factors worked together to BLITZ the American public from the 1980s to the late 90s (until its copyright status was restored). I remember these dark days, when It's A Wonderful Life was literally shown on half a dozen channels at the same time!! Not even GREAT movies should be shown that much! As a result, many began proclaiming it a classic while some others got awfully tired of seeing it--which is a shame because it's a very good film.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">It's a Wonderful Life is something truly special, and along with Scrooge, the original Miracle on 34th Street and Home Alones 1 and 2, it is something I watch every Christmas. Why? Because I love this movie, seriously I do. Looking through my 1000 or so reviews here, I couldn't believe I hadn't reviewed this movie; I have seen movies that I have loved and cherished since childhood and I have seen movies that belong at the bottom of the garbage. It's a Wonderful Life belongs to the former, although I am 17, I appreciate a good movie when I see one. This is more than a good movie, it's a timeless masterpiece, that holds up on repeated viewings and never loses its magic.<br/><br/>It's a Wonderful Life could have easily been overly-sentimental and clichéd, but the quality of the direction and the screenplay that others have summed up perfectly assured it was a beautiful, heart-warming and somewhat poignant film. While there are some funny parts, not bursting-your-gut funny but funny in a subtle sort of way, other parts are close to heart-rending. The direction from Frank Capra is excellent, sensitive and nuanced, and Capra shows even more talent as a screenwriter having penned one of the most honest and touching scripts ever in a film. Casablanca, All About Eve and The Shawshank Redemption all had wonderful scripts, but the script here has a lot to say about community spirit and shows that this film is much more than feel-good sentimentality. There is the element of feel good here, no doubt about it, but it doesn't overpower what the film intends.<br/><br/>Visually, It's a Wonderful Life is a wonder. I don't think it is dated at all, the cinematography is crisp, the black and white looks beautiful and the pristine Christmas scenery really does take me back. Some of my favourite ever memories was of Christmas, whether it was watching nostalgic Christmas videos, eating Christmas dinner or singing carols under the Christmas tree. Another thing I have to mention is that the movie is richly and beautifully scored, Dmitri Tiomkin's music here is absolutely gorgeous, lyrical, whimsical, nostalgic and most importantly it never felt intrusive in the more integral parts of the film. And I have to mention the story, never in my life(and I genuinely mean this) have I seen a movie where it communicates such a strong message and so well too. The story of a suicidal man who is shown the value of his life by his guardian angel is an effective, timeless one, imitated perhaps but never equalled.<br/><br/>Finally the acting is wonderful. James Stewart, and I seriously don't give a damn whether he was a racist or not and neither should you, is absolutely superb as George Bailey, a truly complex character who goes through such a lot to get to where he is at the end of the movie. George Bailey is like Mr Deeds, John Doe and Mr Smith rolled into one, and in my opinion only James Stewart could have given justice to a character that has self-doubt gnawed at his essential decency. Also the character change, like that of Alistair Sim's Scrooge at the end of Scrooge, was heart-breakingly believable. Donna Reed is radiant and charming as his wife, who is like a caring lover, devoted wife and dedicated mother, while Thomas Mitchell gives one of his more memorable performances as Uncle Billy. Henry Travers is a revelation as Clarence the guardian angel, but there is another performance I think is worth of mention. For a good morality tale, you need a good villain. Well in the name of Potter, you have one. Who better to portray him than the great Lionel Barrymore acting at the peak of his powers? <br/><br/>Overall, a timeless classic with a true and heart-rendingly poignant ending. 10/10, one of the easiest perfect scores I have made recently.

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I've always thought that the reason It's A Wonderful Life has had such enduring popularity is that more than in any other film it shows what can be the value of a single individual and the contribution to the greater good they can make.<br/><br/>George Bailey as portrayed by James Stewart is the kind of every man hero we can all identify with. He's got the every day problems to be sure, raising and providing for a family, but he's got bigger problems than that. Fate has made him the rallying point of opposition in his small town of Bedford Falls to the \"richest and meanest man in town\", embodied in Lionel Barrymore.<br/><br/>It's a real David vs. Goliath battle. Barrymore seems to have unlimited resources at his disposal. Samuel S. Hinds as Peter Bailey put it so well to him in asking what are you doing all this for? Barrymore does have more money than he could ever possibly use. A little charity wouldn't hurt him.<br/><br/>Remember the basic plot outline. A whole lot of people in Bedford Falls one post World War II Christmas Eve see that their friend George is toting a heavy load of mysterious origins. Their prayers reach the heavens where an angel is dispatched to aid.<br/><br/>But before Henry Travers the angel arrives, he's given the story of George Bailey's life. And we see the kind of struggles he's had, the sacrifices he's made for the good of a whole lot of others. We've also seen a greedy and grasping Potter, grabbing everything that George Bailey cannot save. <br/><br/>Something happens that day before Christmas through no fault of his own, Bailey is in big trouble. It's driven him to the brink of despair. That's why the angel is sent down. He shows him the alternate universe that would have been had he never existed. It's something each and every one of us should try to do, step outside ourselves see just what our contributions can be.<br/><br/>But I think what Frank Capra is trying to say in this greatest of his films is that having done that and we realize we haven't contributed to the greater good of humankind, we resolve to do so. It's a simple, but profound lesson.<br/><br/>What if Potter got the same opportunity? In a sense Charles Dickens did just that in A Christmas Carol. Would Lionel Barrymore change? It's an interesting point of speculation.<br/><br/>In addition to those cast members already mentioned a whole group of players who worked with Capra before grace this film. Add to that some others and you have a perfectly cast feature picture.<br/><br/>Donna Reed has an interesting part as well. Your choice of mate is real important in life. Had she not been as loving and supportive to George Bailey, he might very well have taken a different route in life. Mary Hatch Bailey became a signature part for her, more identified than her role in From Here to Eternity which got her an Oscar. It certainly was the basis for her TV series.<br/><br/>When Todd Karns who plays Harry Bailey toasts his brother he's saying that the riches of the world are not necessarily things that can be quantified. Your life is not measured in material things, but in how you use the material things given you. <br/><br/>And that universal lesson will be taught into eternity as long as It's A Wonderful Life is shown every year. Wouldst we all learn it.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Frank Capra's 1946 drama/fantasy IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is one of the best-remembered films of all time, and it's no surprise; this moralistic tale of human suffering, poverty, greed, courage and determination is one that resounds through the ages, particularly so in our modern age of fat-cat bankers and a growing gap between rich and poor.<br/><br/>James Stewart gives a dependably decent turn as George Bailey, a family man who finds himself at the mercy of Lionel Barrymore's criminal banker, Mr. Potter. What follows is lengthy and often profound, an occasionally twee but ultimately moving exploration of the human character and the effect one man can have on his world.<br/><br/>What I particularly liked about IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is the way that every part of the narrative hangs together without any unnecessary extras. Even the little bits like the accident on the ice at the outset later come back to haunt our characters. It's very well written, and expertly directed by Frank Capra; an unashamedly old-fashioned, heart-warming and sentimental piece of movie-making on a grand scale. I'd even go so far as to call it the ultimate Christmas film.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">It's a Wonderful Life (1946)<br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>This timeless classic has James Stewart playing George Bailey, a frustrated businessman who gets the chance to see what the world would have been like had he never been born. I've lost count of how many times I've watched this film over the years but it keeps getting better with each new viewing and I can't help but notice new things each time I watch it. There's really nothing I could add that hasn't already been said about this movie but it's certainly one of my all time favorites and I'd argue that it's one of the greatest ever made. This movie has been called timeless by many people but I really can't think of too many movies where this is more true. I can't possibly see how this movie would ever grow old fashioned or out of touch because there's always going to be people who feel like the main character here. The most amazing thing to me is that the film perfectly captures how someone might begin to feel that they're worthless and I can't help but think that anyone who watches this movie will have a better look on life or themselves after watching it. I really can't think of too many movies that contain as much power as this one but I'd say that's why new fans are gained each and every passing year. The greatness of the film is certainly its heart but Stewart also deserves a lot of credit for his marvelous performance, which is certainly one of the best of his career. There are countless scenes in this movie where Stewart just nails it and I'm sure everyone knows the praying in the bar scene but there are many other great ones as well. On this viewing the scene on the bridge when Stewart begs for his life back hit me unlike any other time. There's also the scene in the bank where George has to bargain with the people not to take all of their money. Lionel Barrymore was always great playing bad guys and I can't help but think he's one of the greatest villains in movie history. The evilness that Barrymore is able to get through this character makes it among the actors best work. Donna Reed, Thomas Mitchell and Harry Travers also add great support. Every inch of this movie works flawlessly and that includes the sequences where George gets to see things as if he were never born. I think these moments contain Capra's greatest work as a director as the darkness and atmosphere he creates is so think and depression that it perfectly puts you in the mind frame of George. Then you've got that priceless ending, which ranks right up there with City Lights and Psycho as being the greatest for any movie.</div>\n",

An angel named Clarence is assigned to give George a second chance by showing him what if he was never born.<br/><br/>This is an unabashed sentimental tear jerker. The movie starts with George's life as it is. His dream is to travel the world, and create great monuments. He is constantly dragged back to the unimpressive little Bedford Falls and the family Savings and Loans. He is a good guy who constantly does the right thing.<br/><br/>This is classic Frank Capra. The nice guy struggles but always win in the end. This sentimental melodrama is especially fitting for the Christmas period, and derives its iconic status from the constant showing during those times. The failure in its original run is a long forgotten memory.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Once again, my two cents' worth of a film that is the darling of so many people, myself included.  It has its uplifting conclusion, and the theme that every life has its purpose in the great scheme of things.  George Bailey is in trouble.  He has decided to end it all.  The thought of jail and disgrace is more than he can handle.  George's life has been a continual parade of missed opportunities.  There is a layer of pain just above the surface of nearly every scene.  George is a victim and this series of disappointments takes its toll.  He eventually becomes hardened and frustrated, but because he is honorable, he goes about the business of living.  He has gifts he doesn't realize.  He has family.  He has status, and while not often appreciated, he is.  Unfortunately, we don't always share our love and admiration with those who deserve it.  His sense of adventure from birth has been clutched from him over and over.  His bad ear makes the army an impossibility, his father's death forces him to run a business he wants to run away from, and even his honeymoon money is used to prevent a run on the bank.  George never knows his importance until Henry Travers' well meaning angel comes along.<br/><br/>I love this movie, but I also take it seriously.  It can be painful to watch sometimes.  The best scenes are the ones where George never existed.  His despair is evident and the tension builds higher and higher.  When he comes back, such a weight that is lifted. Jimmy Stewart is at the top of his acting form; I loved him as a living human being and as an actor; he portrays the kindness I believe the world should have.<br/><br/>And then there is Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore, Ward Bond, and all the others.  They are superb.  It's a question all of us have wrestled with: \"What if we had never existed?\"  There is no peer in Capra's canon.  I truly believe that this is a necessary part of our heritage.  We need to see things as they should be.  I love Christmas because it at least portends to be the time we all look at our gifts.  This movie is a gift to the world and one we can learn from over and over, even if the events never took place.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">In looking at this glorious Christmas classic, it's easy to get so involved in the psychology behind it. we obviously become so caught up in our own lives that we often forget about how others around us have influenced who we become and vice versa. This film, which has been redone in many different forms, including taking popular characters from TV shows, both daytime and nighttime and putting them in the same situation as Jimmy Stewart, truly stands the test of time. Not only is it watching one man's slow destruction from things that seem to be beyond his control, it's seeing how one person can deal with the ruthless machinations of the pure evil around him and open the eyes of everybody else to see what's really going on.<br/><br/>In a return to the Christmas theme that he earlier used in 1941 classic \"Meet John Doe\", director Frank Capra saves the seasonal Twist of the story for the film's last half-hour. An unseen angel is sent to a small town to aid a possible suicide victim when the actions of the greedy and evil Lionel Barrymore threatens to send him to prison for embezzlement. Stewart's life is seen in flashbacks for much of the film, but when the film joins the present day, it is almost like it has gone some 70 years into the future to today with Barrymore representing the truly evil Scrooge like banker who wants to control everybody's life.<br/><br/>It is quite a shocker to see Barrymore playing such a nasty, evil man after playing the kindly Dr. Gillespie in the series of MGM medical dramas. he is basically expanding the role of Scrooge which he did on radio for many years and adds an essence of true malevolence to his characterization. Even Scrooge wasn't as crass as his character here. It seems to be a continuation of the role that Edward Arnold played so beautifully in Capra's earlier films \"Mr Smith Goes to Washington\" and \"Meet John Doe\".<br/><br/>The lovely Donna Reed crosses over from MGM ingenue to classy leading lady, adding much depth to her role of Stewart's girlfriend, later wife, with Beulah Bondi saintly as usual his lovable mother. (Bondi played Stewart's mother in so many films and on TV that it is obvious that somehow in real life, he did call her ma.) Then there's Gloria Grahame as the town flirt, Thomas Mitchell as Stewart's rascal uncle, and of course Henry Travers as Clarence, the angel who desperately wants his wings. The smaller roles are filled out by many familiar actors, some of whom were in pretty much every Capra film, as well as Danny Mummert and Larry Simms, both from the \"Blondie\" series and Karolyn Grimes, an underrated child star who stole many movie programmers in the mid-1940s.<br/><br/>There are so many other things to credit for this film's excellence beyond the cast and direction, namely the brilliant script, fast pacing and brilliant production design. This film holds up regardless of whether you see it in its original black-and-white form or it's decently restored colorized version. I'm not in favor of colorizing classic movies, but somehow this one actually came out all right. while I watch this one every other year rather than every year, I can say that I am continuously touched and discover new seems in its that I had not seen before. It is no wonder that this is on nearlt everybody's list of the top Christmas movies of all time.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">In It's a Wonderful Life, George Bailey (James Stewart) is man who wants out from his small town life but something always keeps him from breaking out and fulfilling his dreams. Instead he ends up working in the family loan company, helping other people out. He has a wife Mary (Donna Reed) and four children in an old house which they make their home.<br/><br/>On Christmas Eve, George's Uncle Bill loses $8000 while he is attempting to deposit the money in the bank but loses track when he brags to the town bigwig Mr Potter. The Bailey family nemesis, Mr Potter (Lionel Barrymore) finds the cash but keeps it to himself. George realises when the bank auditor finds out that the accounts do not match he might lose everything and go to jail. George decides to kill himself However an angel Clarence (Henry Travers) is sent to save him and to show him how valuable his life is to the people around him by taking him to the time as if he was never born where he sees an alternate timeline. George discovers that he has made a positive contribution to many peoples lives.<br/><br/>The story has been told many times since then in television, books and films. Even the last episode of Classic Dallas was a variant of this movie based on the Ewings if JR was not around!<br/><br/>The film is regarded as an all time classic and it does have merits for being novel such as the beginning of the picture with a supreme being calling for an angel and the angel being one who has yet to gain his wings that is another story done many time since.<br/><br/>The film is charming, winsome but also a shade too long. The alternate timeline where the town becomes a cesspit looks improbable with Mary being a spinster librarian, a friend of George (Violet) becoming a good time girl and other townsfolk becoming nasty and rather brutish.<br/><br/>Also Mr Potter never seems to get his comeuppance, even during the days of the code Mr Potter still managed to find a way round things!</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">On the Christmas Eve of Bedford Falls, the guardian angel Clarence (Henry Travers) is assigned to convince the desperate George Bailey (James Stewart) to not commit suicide. George is a good man, that sacrificed his dreams and his youth on behalf of the citizens of his small town. He inherited the loan business of his father and he gave up traveling the world and joining the university as scheduled. Later he resisted the proposals of the evil banker Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore) and has never sold his business to protect the poor community of Bedford Falls and offer a means to afford to buy their own house. He married his beloved Mary Hatch Bailey (Donna Reed) and had four children with her and a tough life with his family. When his uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell) loses US$ 8,000.00, found and stolen by Mr. Potter, George decides to commit suicide, since he believes he worth more dead than alive. When Clarence sees that he is not able to persuade George to give up his intention, he decides to show the life in town if George had never existed. George concludes that life is wonderful.<br/><br/>\"It's a Wonderful Life\" is certainly one of the most beautiful movies of the cinema history ever. This masterpiece has a touching and moralist story, showing that the famous sentence that a man can make the difference is true. Everything works perfectly in this movie. The original screenplay develops the situation and the characters accurately, using flashbacks and magnificent lines. The direction of Frank Capra is outstanding as usual. The cinematography in black &amp; white and using shadows and lights is fantastic. James Stewart leads an amazing cast, showing a perfect chemistry with the gorgeous Donna Reed, in the role of a compassionate and enlightened good man. Lionel Barrymore is also amazing in the role of the despicable banker. I do not recall how many times I have already seen this film, but last time was 16 Dec 2000. This is the type of movie that a lover of cinema will never get tired of watching many times. My vote is ten.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): \"A Felicidade não se Compra\" (\"The Happiness Is not Bought\")</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">`George Bailey is a pillar of his community whose life has been selflessly dedicated to the welfare of others.  Through the evil machinations of the town's business mogul, George is driven to the point of suicide.  In answer to the prayers of the townsfolk, a missing angel comes to the rescue.  He shows George what a sad and sorry place the town would have been without him.  Can this life George out of his despair?'<br/><br/>Who hasn't seen this film?  Anyone?  It is an unashamed tribute to homely values and is hugely warming.  The story itself is not exactly rocket science, but it is does contain plenty of nice touches as we follow George through his life of missed opportunities and sacrifice through to his marriage and eventual down fall.  The world that this happens seems so distant nowadays, with our friendless society - so few people do anything for their fellow man in big cities etc.  So this is very touching to see a man who serves others in such a major way.  It is a story of how every little helps and how you cannot overdo friendly gestures.<br/><br/>Stewart is excellent with his partner Capra.  Barrymore is also excellent in a thankless role - he represents all that is wrong in society and of course he rises to a powerful position.  Henry Travers is good as Clarence, the wingless angel and of course who can forget the excellent Donna Reed as Mary.<br/><br/>It's pure hokum of course, the regular Christmas movie that lifts everyone's spirits.  But isn't this what we all wish the world was like really?  Why can't it be - if only for two hours.  This is what Stewart and Capra do best - enjoy and forget the real world.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Is life really wonderful? I'm certain a lot of cynics would like to disagree from the outset. Sometimes I'm one of them it seems. But back to this and a man (Stewart, always good and good looking) that has done a lot of good ... but seems to get into trouble nonetheless. He's only human after all - but who could help him? Well other humans, but not in a direct way.<br/><br/>Especially the later part of the movie takes off, giving us a payoff that we deserve I'd say. It's fascinating how much people seem to be in love with this movie, but it makes sense. It shows that through all the struggle, there can be hope. Even at your lowest point possible, never surrender, never give up, never quit (wait is that the Cobra Kai mantra? Also did I offend you by even comparing that? It doesn't make sense I know ... right? I think ... let's get back to the movie shall we?).<br/><br/>So while there is a simple tale here (if you think about it), it is also a morality tale. It is a tale with a social but also personal message! And it is also a message of humanity and strength and the will and the mental strength to overcome hurdles ... A Christmas Carol has similarities to this, though I have to admit, I don't know how intended they are ... I'd guess more than intended, but that's just me. So sit back and enjoy a family film that has its ups and downs and may feel dated at times, not to mention predictable and putting the viewer ahead many times when it comes to knowing stuff way before our lead character does ... but one that is as feel good as they get ...</div>\n",

The characters, the situations, the message all come together in a way that intrinsically defines it as a Christmas movie, but when you get right down to it, the film transcends Christmas in a way that's truly heartwarming and magical. Jimmy Stewart had that unique ability to put the Everyman into his roles, and this picture certainly qualifies as one of his finest performances. Donna Reed could not have been a better choice to play Mary, displaying a wholesome sex appeal to go along with those traditional home town American values that pictures of the era were so skillful in portraying. Had Director Frank Capra made only this one picture, it would have earned him recognition as one of the true masters of cinema. I could go on and on, but there's really no point in trying to heap further accolades on a picture that has earned it's place in American film right at the top. Watch it, and watch it again, and in taking the picture's message to heart, reach out and help an angel earn it's wings.</div>\n",

It portrays Clarence meeting Donald Rumsfeld and showing the defense secretary how the world would be if he'd never existed. The world would be a much better place: no Iraq war and we'd have caught Osama bin Laden almost immediately.<br/><br/>I wrote an extension of that idea portraying that Fonzie is president and the characters from \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\", \"The Beverly Hillbillies\", \"Bewitched\", \"Gilligan's Island\", \"I Dream of Jeannie\", \"Get Smart\", \"The Flying Nun\", \"The Brady Bunch\", \"All in the Family\" and \"Sanford and Son\" are in his cabinet.<br/><br/>But anyway, \"It's a Wonderful Life\" is worth seeing.

And yet, as of 2014, it seems to be appreciated more than ever. Not that it is a flawless film. The editing, for example, is pretty rotten. And critical, it is probably not a great film, especially alongside \"The Best Years of Our Lives\", which came out around the same time. But this film really hits the heart.<br/><br/>There are some parallels here with \"A Christmas Carol\", only now it is Bob Cratchitt who is the one in a need of a visit from a supernatural friend.

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">This is the best Christmas film ever made from Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated director Frank Capra. The film begins with seeing most of the past of George Bailey (Oscar nominated James Stewart), before going to the present day, Christmas Eve, where he, as a businessman is losing the plot of life, including living with his wife Mary Bailey (Donna Reed) and his kids. Also, Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore) is threatening George with asking for money and trying to tempt George into buying the Baileys business. When money goes missing, Potter won't help him (for being rude) and he has a fit with his wife and kids, he soon thinks about ending his life. Until he meets Clarence (Henry Travers), who calls himself an angel without wings, he can only earn them by helping George. To prove himself, Clarence grants George the wish that he never existed. When George goes back to town everything has changed, the twon is called Pottersville instead of Bedford Fals, members of his family are no longer around, and nobody recognises him, not even his wife. When George discovers how much of a difference he makes to the city he wishes to be back again. It is heart-warming when he is so happy to be back to normal and he ends up as a millionaire, and Clarence got his wings. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Film Editing, Best Sound and Best Picture. James Stewart number 12 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 3 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, and he was number 13 on The World's Greatest Actor, George Bailey was number 9 (Hero) and Mr. Potter was number 6 (Villain) on 100 Years, 100 Heroes &amp; Villains, the film was number 4 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers for the happy ending, it was number 8 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, it was number 37 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, it was number 10 on The 100 Greatest Christmas Moments, it was number 11 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, it was number 1 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers, and it was number 7 on The 100 Greatest Films. Outstanding!</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I've only watched this revered classic film one time. It was okay but disappointing. I expected more after hearing of its great reputation. True, it was interesting but it had too many frustrating and annoying parts for my tastes. It was not the feel-good film I was expecting.<br/><br/>I admit the ending was terrific and brings a tear to one's eye with an inspiring message but much of the film deals with tough breaks that \"George Bailey\" (Jimmy Stewart) had to face and also featured a very mean, despicable dishonest man in \"Mr. Potter\" (Lionel Barrymore). A lot of those scenes were not fun to watch; more frustrating than anything else. The movie has several scenes in which Bailey isn't the best person, either, but it could be argued that everyone has their moments, so why not him, too? <br/><br/>Since this is so beloved a film, and such a Christmas favorite, I just expected more of a nice, lighthearted, good-natured story. Instead, I got a very dramatic movie with a number of unpleasant scenes.<br/><br/>Interesting that this would be a Christmas favorite when Stewart's character admits he doesn't know if God answers prayer, or if He's even there. All of this coming from a guy who's attended church for years? Well, at least he found out, and it was a good message.<br/><br/>The \"message\" was that everyone's life counts for something, that life is important and what you do with it especially important because it effects not just you but a number of other people many times in ways you could never imagine.<br/><br/>To its credit, the story is an involving one. I will have check this out again and perhaps, with a different outlook going into it, will learn to like this film.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">This classic film opens with the voices of various people praying for George Bailey; it is clear that their prayers will be answered when voices in the heavens discuss how to help him. Angel Clarence will be assigned to save George but first Clarence, and the audience, must see how George came to be considering suicide. As a child George Bailey dreamt of getting out of the small town of Bedford Falls; he wanted to see the world, get an education then make his mark on the world. It wasn't to be though; he constantly sacrifices his dreams to help others. This leaves him stuck in the town running the savings and loan company that his father ran. It isn't a job he wanted but he does it anyway giving loans to people nobody else will help. This makes him popular with everybody apart from the miserly Mr. Potter who doesn't like to see the people who were paying him to rent slums buying their own houses. The years pass and George gets married and has children; he isn't rich but he is content; then one day Potter gets the opportunity to ruin George; thinking the only way he can help his family is to kill himself for the insurance we get to the point the film started. As he hits the depth of despair Clarence appears in his life and showed him just what the town would have been like if George had never been born; a miserably place full of bitter people lorded over by the odious Potter. When George returns he understands what good friends he has.<br/><br/>I'd obviously heard of this film a long time ago but had somehow never seen it until today. I knew the film was considered a classic and think James Stewart was a fine actor so I had to watch it when it was on television. Now that I have seen it I ban see why it is held in such high regard. I was a little put off by the opening but once we started seeing George's life from the time he saved his brother's life when he was twelve till the very end I was engrossed. Stewart did a great job as George; the man destined to miss out on his dream each time it looked as though it would come true... even the moment he was about to go away on his honeymoon was ruined meaning he couldn't go. It isn't all disappointment though; there are many joyful scenes as George helps various people and falls in love and then marries Mary Hatch. By the end it is likely that the viewer will have shed tears of both sorrow and joy. If you haven't seen it yet watch it the next chance you get and if you have seen it I'm sure you don't need anybody else to tell you how good it is!</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Heartwarming Frank Capra film which has become (quite unintentionally, I presume) a Christmas perennial. Set in small town America, James Stewart stars as a discouraged and suicidal banker who learns a lesson about life from an angel anxious to get his wings. Fantasy with a holiday theme took many years to garner its classic status, yet it's a shrewd mixture of comedic, dramatic, and emotional elements. Capra's direction is quite sensitive, creating an evocative overview of middle America and the struggling working class. Stewart gives his usual sterling performance, and Donna Reed is a good romantic screen match for him; Henry Travers is the perfect twinkle-eyed old angel. Capra also co-adapted the screenplay based on the short story \"The Greatest Gift\" (which seems to have a touch of Dickens as well). Later remade as the 1977 TV movie \"It Happened One Christmas\", which featured Marlo Thomas in the lead. *** from ****</div>\n",

It is currently available on Amazon streaming movies.<br/><br/>WW2 ended in 1945 and this movie was made in 1946. The premise is straightforward, George Bailey ( James Stewart, 38 at the time) had been a fine boy growing up and now as an adult often gave up his own goals for the benefit of others, like his younger brother. Perhaps too generous, when his Building and Loan business was in trouble he was contemplating suicide as a way out, thinking the world would be better off if George Bailey had never existed.<br/><br/>An angel is sent down to intervene, in the last third of the movie George gets to see exactly how his town would have been and in the process gets his head straight.<br/><br/>Donna Reed (23 at the time) played his wife Mary who would have been the stereotypical \"old maid librarian\" if George had never existed.<br/><br/>Filmed in glorious B&amp;W, the film holds up very well all these years later when one pits it against other very old movies.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Frank Capra's sometimes dark post-war film, \"It's a Wonderful Life\" was released in 1946. It was intended to be released in 1947, but when a Technicolor print of \"Sinbad\" couldn't be delivered on time, this film was put into release. For that reason, \"It's a Wonderful Life\" - possibly the most wonderful film ever made - was overshadowed by \"The Best Years of Our Lives.\" But you can't keep a great film down, and as the years have passed, \"It's a Wonderful Life\" has found its place as an iconic film that means Christmas. It's survived the public domain (due to a clerical error, when the copyright was not renewed in 1974), where it was cut to ribbons and shown so often on television (and why not, networks could show it for nothing) that people were sick of it. Now that it has to be licensed again in order to be shown, the film is shown in its totality and not as often.<br/><br/>This remarkable story of a man who sacrifices his dreams for the betterment of his community and the business his father built resonates today more than ever, when it often seems like no one cares about anything except what's in it for them. James Stewart is perfect as a caring man who swallows disappointment after disappointment and finally is ready to give up, until he is given the gift of seeing what would have happened had he never been born. No man, he learns, is poor who has friends.<br/><br/>I can't think of a better message or anything more inspirational than can be found in this film. George Bailey is all of us, and his story is a reminder that we're all important and, no matter how tough it gets, we need to keep going. One of my favorite movies.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I should be inclined to say that Frank Capra made his masterpiece with It's a Wonderful Life, and it would probably be the obvious, easy answer to make as a movie-lover. And shock of shocks, it wasn't until today (of Christmas Eve of all times, ho-ho-ho) that I finally sat down and watched it- it wasn't a 'family staple' in my house- but I knew I had to watch it, if only to see James Stewart in the seminal role of George Bailey. It is, no doubt, with enough fantastical scenes to make up a couple more movies, and the heart that sits right in It's a Wonderful Life beats with all the vigor and pride of the most schmaltzy- and rightly proud of it- American spirit. That I ended up not finding it to be a truly astonishing movie may be that I'm just a cynic deep down, or that maybe this kind of story, and how it plays out, has ended up being done so many times I practically knew what the story was before going in. It's the most amazing of credits to Capra and his cast and crew that it does hold up this well, and that the sentimentality stringing together much of what happens is actually well earned. But it does teeter on becoming a bit too dated, or rather that it's appeal of being a fable really only works best when dealing with the crux of the character George Bailey, and almost becomes weird in how it leaps from great happiness to the terrible bleakness of modern American life.<br/><br/>Indeed, Stewart was not only the best choice for George Bailey, but the correct one, the kind we'd probably all like to have in our town as the man who despite his better senses commits his life to being there for the ones he cares for. It almost becomes a running gag, however not really funny as much as touching, the way he puts aside his own feelings and self-wants to help save the bank and Bedford Falls from the peril that could come from the dastardly Potter (Lionel Barrymore, cast perfectly for the role as well with his sinister eyebrows and cunning attitude). I first thought it would be all about George seeing life as if he had never been born, but really this is(wisely) kept to the last twenty minutes of the picture. This works because we see how Bailey gets to that point of almost jumping off into the river, which in its selfish way would be, to him, still a selfless act (i.e. worth more than dead). Seeing George's life is like peering into one of those tall-tale American stories where the little guy gets a lot done by just being himself- or at least his better self getting the better of him. All George wants to do as a young man is explore the world, make great buildings and things. But any lofty ambition becomes squashed by reality- of his father's death, of the very sneaky attitude imposed by Potter, and by the townspeople practically needing some hope during the depression. So it's up to him to not only save the town by making a section of the town named after him for low-cost housing, but to marry a girl Mary (Donna Reed) who's fallen totally for George.<br/><br/>What ends up being most memorable, for me, about It's a Wonderful Life is the skill which Capra makes possibly one-dimensional figures very real and immediate, and that in this seemingly simplistic world of right and wrong and good and bad there are the slivers of gray that work their way in. I loved one scene in particular where Potter, desperate to gain back control over his possible monopoly in Bedford Falls, tries to will George away to work for him at far more an amount of money he would make on his own terms with his small bank. It's a tense scene in how devilish Potter comes off, and how Barrymore turns on the ideal of greed and necessity and the ego of a man over the higher principles that George ultimately goes for. It's always fascinating too to see how Stewart plays certain scenes and lines and inflections, moments of surprise and delight which probably hide just the bits of bitterness that build up in him. There's something about the American dream that is called into question in American life, even as Capra likes to jump from sweet touches of light comedy to stark tragedy or danger. There's a great juxtaposition that is made too with the characters of Harry Bailey, George's brother, who goes on to lead the life George might have led had he not saved Harry as a boy, and as well in a small part with Sam Wainwright.<br/><br/>It's through the sort of realistic groundings then that Capra is able to get away with reaching for the fantasy structure that ends up coming out of the film, the typical 'what if' nightmare scenario that has ended up influencing countless movies and TV shows. Like Christmas Carol, though sort of in reverse, it's sort of meant as a lesson in humanity, and how what is carried in a man or what is lacking in it ends up bringing it out or losing it in others. It all builds to help Capra earn the melodrama and ultra-heightened emotions brought out with Clarence the angel. It doesn't mean that, at least for me, there aren't things that end up being dated (however, scenes like the dance-hall bit in 1928, is timeless in its humor), mainly in how the idealism and old-fashioned ways come out in this day &amp; age. But still, it doesn't stop me from saying that It's a Wonderful Life is a must see, if only once, and there's no doubt why it's been revered as one of the great films about the triumph of the human spirit.

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Since I first saw this classic in 1981, I've seen an episode of Laverne and Shirley with this premise (it's Laverne who imagines this scenario), a musical version on stage with Ernie the taxi driver-not Martini-owning a bar, and last year a Baton Rouge Little Theater presentation with dialogue almost taken verbatim from the movie. Nothing however compares to the original film interpretation. How can one not laugh when George (Jimmy Stewart) and Mary (Donna Reed) accidentally fall into the high school gym swimming pool after Mary ditched a potential suitor (Carl \"Alfalfa\" Switzer)? Or not get touched by George's speech defending his late father to Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore)? Certainly the last hour as George feels the world tumbling before him and his eventual appreciation of his life are some of the most tear-and-laugh inducing scenes I've ever seen in the movies or television. It's a Wonderful Life has always been my favorite movie and nothing I've ever seen has even come close. Kudos to Stewart and director Frank Capra for such a life-affirming project. Thanks also to Barrymore, Reed, Switzer, Samuel S. Hinds (George's father Peter), Beulah Bondi (George's mom), Thomas Mitchell (Uncle Billy), H.B. Warner (Gower the druggist), Gloria Grahame (Violet Bick), Lilian Randolph (Annie the maid), Sheldon Leonard (Nick the bartender), Ward Bond (Bert the cop), Frank Faylen (Ernie the taxi driver), Bill Edmunds (Martini), and Charles Lane in his role as the guy who tells Potter about George's Bailey Park plans for filling the picture with, in Nick's words \"a little atmosphere\". Add to that all the various kid and adult actors I can't remember right now. And finally, special thanks to Henry Travers (Clarence) for making us all believe in angels. No truer words have ever been written as the one in Clarence's book gift (The Adventures of Tom Sawyer) to George: No man is a failure who has friends. Though one may quibble about Harry not being saved without George despite other friends near him or Mary becoming an old maid, It's a Wonderful Life is a flawless masterpiece that has stood the test of time for the last 60 years. May it stand forevermore. P.S. Look for the Blondie movie series' kid stars Larry \"Baby Dumpling/Alexander Bumstead\" Simms (George's son Pete) and Danny \"Alvin Fuddle\" Mummert (Little Marty Hatch). And Ellen \"Grandma Walton\" Corby as the woman George kisses in the run-on-the-bank sequence. Update: 12/25/2020-I just watched the colorized version from Legend Films. While I noticed some detail concerning background and extras I hadn't previously noticed before, I didn't let myself get too distracted by that colorization since except for the skies during the night scene, I didn't notice any scenes that seemed to still be in the original b &amp; w like I did when the first colorization was done by Hal Roach Studios during the late '80s. In other words, I still enjoyed the film enough with that alteration.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">My biggest complaint about \"Apocalypse Now\" is that many who view it might think this is exactly like the Vietnam War. Instead, it's almost like a non-funny spoof--satirizing it instead of showing an actual view of the war. The film shoves a decade of surreal incidents and some completely fictional ones along with incorporating Joseph Conrad's book \"Heat of Darkness\" and the Herzog film \"Aguirre: The Wrath of God\" into this vision. The results are pretty amazing...just NOT the actual Vietnam War. In other words, there was too much craziness for one movie--but it did make for exciting and compelling viewing nevertheless.<br/><br/>The first 2/3 of the film is very much like \"Aguirre\", as it shows a group of misfits taking a CIA operative (Martin Sheen) upriver into Cambodia on a secret assassination mission. Along the way, TONS of insane little vignettes are shoved into the movie--some of which are patently ridiculous. Now I must say that when the film was released, some of the more surreal and ridiculous scenes were removed--such as the Playboy bunny scenes which simply make no logical sense. But the reason so much illogic is shoved into the film is that the filmmaker, Francis Ford Coppola, was NOT trying to make a true depiction of the war. I wish some of this craziness had been toned down a bit--after all, I am a retired history teacher and love truly accurate depictions. But this film is highly fictionalized and Coppola surely wasn't trying to make a documentary.<br/><br/>The final portion is basically right out of \"Heart of Darkness\"--with massive changes here and there (such as the purpose of the visit to Kurtz). Now if you haven't read this book, I do NOT recommend you do so. Believe me, it is one of the more difficult and tedious books I've ever read (yes, English professors, I know you will hit me with lots of 'not helpfuls' because I said this). And, while over the top in many ways, at least it was entertaining--something that could never be said about the book (which, by the way, was not a war story and was set in the Belgian Congo). In fact, an English teacher friend of mine admitted, after I pressured him, that the book was insufferable.<br/><br/>So is the film any good? Sure. Very well done. But remember, it's NOT a work of non-fiction. Now I am NOT defending the Vietnam War (it was screwed up in every way and was one of the dumbest moments in US history) but just don't want the gullible to assume it's fact. For at least a closer view of the reality of the war, try watching \"Full Metal Jacket\". But, for a crazy, surreal and mesmerizing view, give \"Apocalypse Now\" a look. It's like nothing you've ever seen before...<br/><br/>FYI--It should surprise no one that this is a VERY adult movie--especially the \"Redux\" release of 2001. Tons of violence, strong language and graphic nudity are in this film, so don't watch it with your mother-in-law or the kids!!</div>\n",

It is a truly harrowing masterwork with nothing to criticise.<br/><br/>Apocalypse Now is filled with memorable, mystical images, helped by the wonderful cinematography, splendid effects and authentic sceneries. The music is superb, the script is wonderful, I especially loved Robert Duvall's \"I love the smell of napalm first thing in the morning\", the story is always compelling and the film is brilliantly directed by Coppola. Apocalypse Now is long, but it is never boring.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent, Marlon Brando especially is unforgettable, and Martin Sheen, Robert Duvall and Dennis Hopper adeptly support him. Overall, this is harrowing I warn you but it is a brilliant film regardless. 10/10 Bethany Cox</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">We have to wait until there is only a quarter of the running time left before Marlon Brando comes on as Colonel Kurtz. But it's worth the wait to see him give a fabulous performance as a decorated US Army Colonel who has gone over the hill and off the deep end.<br/><br/>Until that time we watch Martin Sheen as an intelligence officer given an assassination assignment to terminate Brando. Brando as a soldier did his job well, too well maybe. Now he's set himself up with an army of Montagnard tribespeople as some kind of potentate deep in the jungle across into Cambodia where Americans aren't supposed to be in any event.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola gave this film almost a surreal quality, it gets more surreal as the PT boat aka swift boat journeys up river to the Kurtz compound. It starts with the real war enough, but even that is a Sam Peckinpah like violence ballet with Robert Duvall replete with western cavalry hat leading a raid on a Viet Cong stronghold at the river mouth with the strains of Wagner's dance of the Valkyries. Duvall loves his aroma of napalm in the morning.<br/><br/>I liked the river journey when Sheen sets out on that PT boat with the ever present mist over the river. It has Hitchcock like suspense, you never know what they will encounter and neither do they. You also see what war has done to the crew in that kind of atmosphere never knowing when they might meet death with an enemy who doesn't operate in the traditional ways of war.<br/><br/>I was lucky enough to see the Redux version with the sequence of Christian Marquand and his plantation. It was cut for length in the original film, but it's worth seeing now. All of those countries used to be called French Indo-China, still remember it on Atlas maps when I was a lad. He's got his manor house there and it's home to him and nobody is going to push him out. An attitude similar to people who followed Ian Smith in Northern Rhodesia when the rest of Africa was shaking off colonialism. I'm glad the scenes have been restored.<br/><br/>Brando is only in briefly, but his performance as the cracker doodle, but perceptive Kurtz is something to see. Also note that Scott Glenn previously sent on Sheen's mission and freelance reporter Dennis Hopper have become Brando acolytes and also standout in their cameos.<br/><br/>Apocalypse Now is not the best Vietnam War film. My own preference is Casualties Of War. But it's definitely worth a look.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Francis Ford Coppola's epic Vietnam story is a classic film by public definition, there's no doubt about it. Fully conveying the horrors of a useless war and the psychological effect upon the people fighting in it, this is powerful and challenging viewing. It's a beautifully shot movie and a highly influential one, helping to launch a whole Vietnam sub-genre at the time of which the Italians were extremely fond. Although if I hear that damned pretentious Coppola quote \"this film isn't about Vietnam - it IS Vietnam\" one more time I'm likely to scream!<br/><br/>The acting is very good and the actors (there are no women here) are frighteningly adept at playing insane men. Martin Sheen provides the focus piece of the movie and his deterioration into madness is so subtle that it's hard to realise that he has become deeply desensitised at the film's end until his final act of brutality. Marlon Brando is, well, Marlon Brando, thankfully on screen for only a short while as his babblings quickly become irritating (although I did like the bit about the snail on the straight razor) Cameos from Robert Duvall as a cowboy-type general and Dennis Hopper as a spaced-out photographer just add to the insanity of it all and a young Larry (now Laurence) Fishburne has the sympathetic role of a young soldier whose life is cut tragically short.<br/><br/>Aside from the realistic action sequences, this is mainly a jungle-trek film, shot on location to give it that extra real look. Fans of the Italian jungle genre would be wise to check this out, as at times this covers very similar ground. The powerful ending has Sheen and friends arriving at Kurtz's hideout to discover all manner of corpses hanging from trees and laying scattered around, with heads everywhere. Sheen's killing of the mad general is intercut with (real) footage of a buffalo being slaughtered in a native ritual - for me, this was sickening, and made the dying words of Brando - \"the horrors, the horrors\" seem all the more appropriate. An unforgettable film, and one that is both dark and very disturbing, although hardly an enjoyable watch; in terms of visual artistry alone it's a masterpiece.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">There are films we watch because they are good, even though they are painful for us. This is a film I saw one time. At that time I thought to myself, this is enough. It was painful to make that journey down the river, wondering what was around every corner. Then we meet the products of our own id impulses, as we are the enemy, our souls have been brought down to this. At the end of the river is the man who came before us, and we see the uselessness of the journey. It is the Heart of Darkness. There are death masters like Robert Duvall. There are those who can only hope to survive, but the war is the master. The Doors music as the napalm settles gently on the treetops and across the ground, sweeps us up gently. Meanwhile it is consuming the flesh of the Vietnamese people, as well as an occasional American soldier. The ancient Romans could not envision peace without war. We and much of the world seem to have embraced those tenets put forth some two thousand years ago. This film gets into the marrow.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">\"Apocalypse Now\" is a 1979 movie by Francis Ford Coppola. 7 years after \"The Godfather\", he reunites with actor Marlon Brando (fat and bald here in his mid-50s), who is really difficult to recognize. He plays a highly decorated soldier, who deserted in Cambodia. However, I felt his part was just too self-indulging. It had \"Give me an Oscar\" written all over it as the final 45 minutes of the film entirely circled around him and everything before as well as he was talked about for pretty much the entire film. However, Brando did not win a single award anywhere for his performance here and the film won Oscars for its cinematography and sound. With the truly big awards, the Academy preferred a family divorce drama that year. The central character in \"Apocalypse Now\", however, is played by Martin Sheen, who shows striking resemblance to his son Charlie in quite a few scenes.<br/><br/>This is probably the most famous anti-war movie of all times. It's in the IMDb top50, but definitely not in my top50. However, I still thought it was a good film. Especially Robert Duvall (Kilgore) succeeds in displaying the insanity of war as he treats combat like a painting, plays classic music to the horrendous scenes and has his guys surfing at the same time. Excellent portrayal. He was the much better Coppola reunion in this movie and the Golden Globe and BAFTA wins were absolutely deserving. And when there is no visual horror...horror (e.g. a severed head or the death of the character played by the very young Laurence Fishburne), we hear people talking about it, for example Kurtz' story on severed children's arms.<br/><br/>The redux version of the movie runs for considerably over 3 hours, about 200 minutes, and I would lie if I said there was not a single moment when it dragged. It did, occasionally, for example when they meet the French guys. I could have done without that part. The cast is pretty spectacular. Apart from everybody I already mentioned, there's also Dennis Hopper, Harrison Ford and Frederic Forrest in this movie, all 3 Academy Award nominees themselves. It's an interesting take on soldiers' lives during this difficult time. But apart from all the brutal battle scenes and (during one scene) the unsuccessful longing for leadership, we also see a bunch of playboy bunnies giving the troops some pleasure with their mere presence.<br/><br/>This is a good film, no doubt about it. You may certainly need some knowledge about historical background to fully appreciate it and even then, it is certainly not for everybody, but watching this film can be a great experience. Visually, it's a masterpiece and the cinematography contributes as much to the nightmarish atmosphere and constant fight for survival as does the music, most of all The Doors' \"This is the End\".</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Coming out on the cusp of several other big award winning Vietnam war films (\"Coming Home\" and \"The Deer Hunter\" which could not have been any more different), this is the most avant garde of them all. While another stack of Vietnam war films came out nearly a decade later, this is perhaps the most controversial. Unlike his son Charlie Sheen's character in \"Platoon\" Martin Sheen's captain here isn't just a recruit facing his own apocalypse from going into combat for the first time. He's experienced, trusted and smart, and that's just one of the reasons he's chosen for the special mission of going deep into the Vietnam jungle to take out one of his own, an American officer who seems to have defected, declared himself to be lord of that jungle and most likely incurably insane.<br/><br/>Director Francis Ford Coppola has declared this to not be anti-war even though he doesn't indicate his own feelings. He claims that this shows why the human psyche constantly gets into wars and uses the Joseph Conrad novel \"Hearts of Darkness\" as his source, changing it to the Vietnam war and exploiting the cruelty and violence, some of it obviously necessary as the attacks on the Viet Cong camps at the start of a day indicate. It's easy to hate those in charge of this action for killing children, and when a young Vietnamese girl tosses something into the helicopter and runs off before it bursts into an inferno can temporarily change how you see this mission before realizing why it had to be done.<br/><br/>In all truth, seeing the nearly 40 year old Martin Sheen here, I did confuse him at first with son Charlie, then 22, in \"Platoon\". Martin looks way younger than his years so it's frightening to see him foisted into this mission to which there's no easy way to accomplish it. The look of disgust on his face while looking on at the impish antics of those on the river boat escorting him downstream is unforgettable. He's obviously already seen horrors that explain the opening scene where he's on a drug trip as the Doors song \"The End\" plays over it.<br/><br/>The subject of the assassination plot is the Colonel played by Marlon Brando in what is basically the highest paid cameo in film history, equivalent to what he had done right before this for \"Superman\". Brando's the one weak element of this film, photographed strangely and often difficult to understand. Perhaps he thought that would add to his character's insanity. Sheen spends time looking at pictures of the younger Brando, altered in photos to appear to be in a military setting.<br/><br/>Since the top billed Brando doesn't appear until later in the film, it's the supporting cast surrounding Sheen that you will remember which includes Robert Duvall, Dennis Hopper, Laurence Fishburne, Frederic Forrest and a young Harrison Ford, basically a cameo but an important scene along G.D. Spradlin. There are a few women in the cast outside the extras playing members of the Viet Cong, and one disturbing scene has a young prostitute at work asking a soldier looking on why he's there, only to heat, \"I'm next.\"<br/><br/>So this glorifies war while also giving an indication of how evil it is and how soul crushing it can be. Sheen's quiet performance seems to emote this, and that gives his performance real power. Many of the battle scenes are at night with screaming voices sounding like ghosts crying out for mercy. This is the type of film that will make you feel guilty when you either cheer or laugh, but that's a part of what makes this film stand the test of time. As a 16 year old watching this in the theater, I felt different emotions than I do 41 years later, not the fear of that sheltered existence of a teenager, but the anger of a mature man still debating why we need to feel the urge to kill. That's the power of cinema when it's done right and why this film is important on so many levels.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I have seen Apocalypse Now so many times over the decades, with various different cuts that Francis Coppola has released. I even once went over parts of the Grand Canyon on a helicopter with Wagner's The Ride of the Valkyries blaring out. It was like experiencing a moment of the movie.<br/><br/>Co written by John Milius, one of the most right wing guys in Hollywood. Apocalypse Now is not really anti war, it sat too much on the fence with the Vietnamese being cannon fodder. The Vietnam War had only ended a few years before the film started production. Major film studios were in no mood to be too overtly critical about the war. That will happen in the 1980s with Oliver Stone.<br/><br/>Coppola uses Joseph Conrad's novel Heart of Darkness as a metaphorical journey. A war that started off with good intentions by the Americans. Help the Vietnamese and save them from communism. You have Colonel Kilgore's (Robert Duvall) gung ho performance that involves Napalm and surfing. It then ends with Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) a once brilliant soldier literally gone mad.<br/><br/>Coppola said of the movie's production \"My film is not about Vietnam, it is Vietnam.\" A typhoon had destroyed the film set in the Philippines. Martin Sheen was encouraged to get drunk for his opening scenes and promptly had a near fatal heart attack. An overweight Marlon Brando turned up on the film set without reading the script. It lead Coppola to shoot Brando with light and shadows to hide his girth.<br/><br/>Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) a Special Ops officer is sent on a secret mission into Cambodia to kill Colonel Kurtz who has gone rogue. He has set up his own military unit with a local tribe using savage methods.<br/><br/>Willard goes up river in a small navy patrol boat to Cambodia. A journey where they meet oddballs, a party of Playboy Playmates entertaining the troops, a trip to a French plantation (Special Editions), a journey that becomes increasingly dark, dangerous and nightmarish. Willard particularly does not care much for the crew of the patrol boat.<br/><br/>Apocalypse Now is an audacious dazzling epic that becomes a journey into madness. I dread to think how much of the Philippine jungle was firebombed during the making of the film. Coppola was at the height of his powers after his success with the two Godfather films. There is wonderful craftsmanship on display. Also wilful disregard for animal life with the slaughter of the water buffalo in the climax. Sorry Francis, your excuse about that scene is lame.<br/><br/>There are supporting roles from Harrison Ford playing Colonel George Lucas to Dennis Hopper playing a wacky journalist in Kurtz's compound. Even Scott Glen has a small non vocal appearance and Laurence Fishburne was only 14 years old when he played one of the crewmen of the patrol boat. The heart of the movie is Sheen. He looks young and innocent but is also suffering from his own traumas and cynicism before he embarks on his mission.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">In an updating of `Hearts of Darkness' a soldier is given a mission to travel up a river During the Vietnam war in order to terminate the command of Colonel Kurtz.  Kurtz is operating without orders and is leading a group of natives in brutal violent strikes against the enemy.  Despite his history of brilliance and decoration he has clearly gone mad.  Willard joins a military boat and travels up river to his destiny.  However the further he travels the more madness appears to have become the norm.<br/><br/>It is a film everyone knows, and a `making of' story that is familiar to everyone on some level.  The problems with the military, with destroyed sets right down to Keitel walking off set to be replaced by Martin Sheen who then had a near complete breakdown during filming.  However the story itself is what keeps this so popular.  The original book is set in Victorian times and is similar only in the concept of travelling up a river and confronting something dark and changed in the shape of Kurtz.  The modern day spin on it makes it even more interesting as it looks at the madness that comes with power within war.<br/><br/>The journey itself is at times comic and at other times brutal.  The overall feeling is one of soldiers not knowing why they are fighting or who they are fighting.  The feeling of confusion and fear is inherent in the film and is very well delivered.  Willard's journey never fails to grip and is interesting on whatever level you watch it  whether it be for the famous set pieces or for the underlying themes.<br/><br/>The performances are excellent.  Sheen has never been better and now seems so distant from his character that he is a different person.  While some of the emotion on screen was real, he does a great job as our guide through the journey.  The best performance comes from a surprising source Brando. Despite the fact that he was difficult, horribly over weight and hadn't learnt his lines, his eerie performance is still haunting.  His mumbling and reasoning in the shadows show that he may be touched by madness but, in the context of war, he is also touched by cold logical reasoning.  Likewise Dennis Hopper fits in well despite his stoned demeanour.  The support cast include some names as Albert Hall, Harrison Ford, Forrest and a young Larry Fishburne.<br/><br/>Overall this will remain a classic on many levels.  The film itself is great and full of spectacle, the story of the making itself is interesting, the performances are wonderful despite everything and the fact that it has other themes makes it even better.  As an war movie it is great simply because it isn't about the war it IS war  in the words of Coppola `it isn't about Vietnam, it is Vietnam, it's how the Americans were in Vietnam.  We were in the jungle, we had too much money, too much equipment and, little by little, we went insane'.  Classic film on so many levels.</div>\n",

Willard joins a military boat and travels up river to his destiny. However the further he travels the more madness appears to have become the norm.<br/><br/>That Redux was going to be anything less than brilliant was never in doubt: it was never going to be so different from the original that it would destroy or significantly damage the reputation or impact that the film has. What was in question to my mind was whether or not Coppola should have just left well enough alone.  I have seen the documentary about the making of the original film, wherein Coppola derides many of his scenes and decides to cut them out of his movie even as he finishes shooting them - the plantation scene being one of the key ones that he felt just didn't work.  It was for this reason that I was interested to see what the additions and rejigging of scenes had done to the film.<br/><br/>The strengths of Redux is that Apocalypse Now was never about the straight story, it was more about the journey Willard undertakes rather than a build up to a traditional conclusion - while the ending is big, it is no more or less important that anything that has gone before it.  So for that reason it is a good thing that, simply put, there is now more of the journey to be enjoyed!  `49 minutes of new material' my dvd cover screams at me; combine this with the movement of scenes and certainly it does have the feel of a different (albeit familiar) film rather than just a bit of spit and polish with some new CGI effects (yes ET, I'm looking at you).  However this increased material also brings with it the problems that not all the material compliments the film in terms of total quality.<br/><br/>None of the added scenes or sequential movements are bad or even average, they are all interesting, but some just don't seem to really fit.  The plantation scene has some great dialogue (that strikes a real chord so recently post-Iraq) and it makes it's points but it just didn't seem to fit. I can see what Coppola was trying to do and, if you watch Hearts Of Darkness, you can see that it frustrates him that it doesn't work, but he got it right first time, it doesn't fit despite it's standalone merits. Likewise the playboy bunny scene intrigued me as I tried to get more from the bunny's semi-speech about being made to do things and the theme of objectification, but again it didn't totally work and seemed out of place.<br/><br/>Despite these two major scenes not totally fitting, they are still interesting and, if you came for the journey, then that is what matters and they present themselves as a flawed part of that journey - but a part of that journey nonetheless.  Some of the smaller additions actually contribute a lot more to the film.  Little moments in the boat show Willard to be more relaxed as a man than the original did - and this greatly benefits my understanding and appreciation of his character.  How he interacts with the rest of the crew is also improved.  Other minor additions to existing scenes serve to enhance them, but improvement in some areas is difficult when it comes to this film.<br/><br/>I won't go into details on cast, performances and the themes of the film as I have already done that in my other review.  Suffice to say that, if you loved Apocalypse Now then Redux will likely both enhance your enjoyment and slightly irritate you at the same time.  The film easily stands up to the longer running time - as another user said, I could easily give the five hour version a stab (well, maybe once!) as the journey is the all.  The additions may not be without flaw, but then that's why they were higher on the editing hierarchy than the rest of the stuff!  However they add interest and minutes to the journey - both of which are good things.<br/><br/>Overall, it is very difficult to take `one of the best films ever madeT ' and make it better - and Coppola hasn't done that here, but he hasn't damaged it either.  It isn't a brand new film and it doesn't mess around with the original so much that it could be called a different film - so I won't compare the two as to which is `better'.  Suffice to say that, while I don't totally agree that you `can't have too much of a good thing', certainly an extra 49 minutes is gratefully received where it doesn't damage or cheapen but only seeks to enhance and support.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Back during the Viet Nam War, a friend of mine from my home town returned from the war and described his first day in combat. He was dropped from a helicopter in the middle of a jungle clearing, while simultaneously realizing that the rifle fire coming his way was from enemies that wanted to kill him. I'm not sure how a sane person filters that type of insanity through any kind of rational prism. Perhaps that's what \"Apocalypse Now\" is meant to convey, as virtually every situation presented makes no sense in a rational world. The surreal takes center stage from beginning to end, with river surfing set to a napalm barrage and playboy bunnies appearing out of the night sky aboard a helicopter. For a generation of movie watchers born after the Viet Nam era, scenes like those might seem like the fevered nightmares of a troubled film maker, but for those who lived it, they were all too real. I guess that's why Viet vets referred to 'The World' as anyplace BUT Viet Nam; in today's experience, one might compare that war to a virtual reality video game, except that you could really die in it.<br/><br/>I recall back in the day how Marlon Brando's presence in the film was highly regarded and anticipated, yet for all that he's in it for only a relatively short time. It's Martin Sheen's picture pretty much all the way, with a supporting cast that while watching today, surprised me with the likes of Sam Bottoms, Laurence Fishbourne, Harrison Ford and Dennis Hopper. Robert Duvall on the other hand, might have cemented his growing reputation here with his 'napalm smell of victory' declaration early in the picture. His portrayal of Big Duke Six Kilgore is the one I remember best from thirty years ago, even though he winds up merely a marginal character.<br/><br/>Interestingly, if one were to remove the context of Viet Nam, the picture would still hold up amazingly well, given the universal oxymoron of military intelligence in a Catch 22 world. Captain Willard's thoughts and actions turn conventional thinking on it's head, while forcing the viewer to re-examine one's own ideas about good and evil, right and wrong, humanity and inhumanity. It's not a comfortable picture to watch, and one which defies the generally accepted definition of entertainment. Nevertheless it's almost certainly a must see picture that challenges one's perceptions about war and it's consequences.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">From the opening scene - with \"The End\" playing while helicopters are attacking a village - to Col. Kilgore's (Robert Duvall) admiration of napalm, to the Playboy bunnies, to the final scene, \"Apocalypse Now\" always hits you like a brick in the face. As Capt. Benjamin L. Willard, searching for renegade Col. Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando), Martin Sheen has what was probably the best role of his career.<br/><br/>Above all, the movie is staunchly anti-war, even more so than \"The Deer Hunter\"; \"Apocalypse Now\" condemns the fact that we were in Vietnam to begin with. The Playboy bunny scene not only shows that the GIs were shown the most despicable stuff for entertainment, but it shows that if you expect to create such emotions, don't expect to be able to control them (in that scene, you can see Vietnamese people outside the compound, and you can only imagine how disgusted they must be at American \"entertainment\").<br/><br/>Col. Kilgore is of course the ultimate rah-rah military type. Among other things, this \"patriot\" ignores a wounded man, preferring instead to go surfing. He doesn't even flinch when there's an explosion. As he cynically notes: \"Charlie don't surf.\" All in all, \"Apocalypse Now\" is one of the greatest movies ever made. With top notch performances by the stars and great support from Frederic Forrest, Laurence Fishburne, Dennis Hopper, Sam Bottoms and Harrison Ford, this is one movie that everyone should see.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I have seen the original version, the Redux version, and The Final Cut, I used to think maybe that the film was overrated, but I'm glad I've seen it a few times and can see why it is considered a \"masterpiece\", from BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated director Francis Ford Coppola (The Godfather, The Conversation, Bram Stoker's Dracula). Basically, the Vietnam war shows no signs of ending, and U.S. Army Captain and special operations veteran Captain Benjamin L. Willard (BAFTA nominated Martin Sheen) has returned to Saigon. He is called upon by Lieutenant General Corman (G. D. Spradlin) and Colonel Lucas (Harrison Ford), military intelligence officers, for a secret mission into the remote jungle. His orders are to follow the Nung River and find Special Forces Colonel Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has gone rogue, and apparently insane practising \"unsound\" methods of dehumanisation. Kurtz may have also developed a cult following from both his troops and the native people, so he is to be terminated for extreme prejudice. Willard heads down the river on a Navy patrol boat, commanded by Chief Phillips (Albert Hall) with crew members Lance B. Johnson (Sam Bottoms), Jay 'Chef' Hicks (Frederic Forrest) and Tyrone 'Clean' Miller (Laurence Fishburne). On the journey, they rendezvous with Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore (Robert Duvall) who commands a squadron of armed helicopters, he agrees to escort them. Kilgore orders a napalm airstrike on the locals below, the music \"Ride of the Valkyries\" plays on loudspeakers as they attack. Willard and the crew continue upriver, he looks through files about Kurtz and how he was once a promising officer. They encounter Vietnamese civilians on the way, there are snap judgements gets with severe consequences. Willard later finds out that another soldier was sent on a similar mission to kill Kurtz, but this soldier defected and joined the cult the rogue commander has created. Lance and Chef are under the influence of drugs are getting out of control, Mr. Clean is killed when the boat is attacked by an unseen enemy in the trees, Chief turns hostile, but they are ambushed again and he is killed being impaled by a spear. Willard confides with surviving members Chef and Lance who reluctantly agree to continue on the mission, and upriver they find a bank littered with corpses. While Chef is able to leave and call an airstrike, the other two soldiers end up captured by Montagnard warriors, and they meet an eccentric Photojournalist (Dennis Hopper) who praises Kurtz as a genius. The soldiers see several decapitated heads scattered outside the cult leader's temple. Willard is taken to see Kurtz in the dark lair, he sees Willard as an errand boy, and Willard screams as Chef's severed head is dropped on his lap. Willard is released and free to explore the compound, Kurtz lectures him on his theories of war, humanity, and civilisation. Kurtz wants Willard to tell his son everything about him in the event of his death, but he kills the cult leader with a machete, his dying words are \"The horror... the horror\". Covered with dark stuff on his face, and having read the chilling words of the now dead commander, and taking them, Willard descends from Kurtz's chamber and drops the blood covered weapon. The villagers kneel like he is their new cult leader, but Willard and Lance are allowed to leave and get back to the boat. Having experienced all this devastation, they ride away with the last words of Kurtz eerily echoing. Also starring G.D. Spradlin as General R. Corman, Scott Glenn as Lieutenant Richard M. Colby, Cynthia Wood as Playmate of the Year, Colleen Camp as Playmate, Miss May, Linda Carpenter as Playmate, Roman Coppola (Francis Ford's son) as Francis de Marais, and a cameo from Francis Ford Coppola as thee Director of the TV Crew. The performances by Sheen, Brando, Duvall, and Hopper are all terrific, and the direction by Coppola is masterful. There were loads of problems during the making of the film, such as firing Harvey Keitel from the lead role, and Sheen having a heart attack, but the idea was to create an idea of what being in Vietnam would be like, and indeed you get that sense of surrealism messing with your mind and the danger of the environment. The highlights are Sheen's (real) drunken moments in his bedroom, the helicopter attack, and Brando's only slightly lit (due to his weight) appearances, overall, it is an interesting and watchable epic war drama. It won the Oscars for Best Cinematography and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Film Editing, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, it was nominated the BAFTAs for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for Carmine and Francis Ford Coppola, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Production Design, Best Sound Track and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Original Score, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Dennis Hopper was number 80, Marlon Brando number 30, and Harrison Ford number 5 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Brando was also number 11 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, he was number 4 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, and Hopper was number 49, and Brando number 1 on The World's Greatest Actor, \"I love the smell of Napalm in the morning\" was number 12 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes, the film was number 2 on The 100 Greatest War Films, it was number 1 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die, it was number 28 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 13 on The 100 Greatest Films.

Martin Sheen is an anguished Army captain in Vietnam in 1968, ordered to proceed up river to the Cambodian border on a Navy River Patrol Boat and assassinate a Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who has apparently gone berserk and established his own little, ruthless anti-communist empire in the jungle.<br/><br/>It's a free transposition of Joseph Conrad's \"Heart of Darkness\" but that hardly matters. Nor does the overall plot. We already know most of it because some of its features have become integral to our vernacular culture. \"I love the smell of napalm in the morning.

The horror.\" (Well -- that last is lifted directly from Conrad's novel, but never mind.) <br/><br/>What Stephen Spielberg did so miraculously with light in \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind,\" Francis Ford Coppola does with smoke here. All kinds of smoke. Gray smoke from gunfire and explosions. Amber smoke from fires. Pink and lime and lavender smoke from flares and grenades. People stalk slowly through it like images from hell. Boats drift through clouds of it.<br/><br/>The lighting (Vittorio Storaro) and special effects contribute to the impact of the film too. Brando's first appearance in unforgettable chiaroscuro. A burnt orange light illuminates his shaved head from the side and turns the naked scalp into a luminous crescent. Then Brando bows his head, dips his fingers into a bowl of water and flutters his fingertips along the skin as if playing a piano or celesta.<br/><br/>Sheen's boat and its two-man crew glide very slowly into the tiny cove which serves as Brando's main port. The place looks like mannequin factory. There are bodies and body parts strewn about. Bodies that are more or less whole droop from the trees and from the gargoyle monuments that surround the entrance to Brando's dark and beckoning castle. Hundreds of half-naked natives with spears and guns have assembled in silence to greet the boat. Out of this unholy horde dances a crazed photographic journalist, the ever reliably crazed Dennis Hopper. He shouts greetings, shakes hands, welcomes them warmly, but adds in a wary tone, \"They think you've come to kill him -- and I hope THAT'S not true.\" He leads the stunned Sheen through the throng that opens before them. Sheen is gaping at some of the body parts. \"The heads -- you're lookin' at the heads! Y'know, sometimes he goes too far, but he'll be the first to admit it, man.\" <br/><br/>Brando is a warrior and a poet. Near the end, one scene seems to be a T. S. Eliot study group gone awfully wrong. He's a philosopher. \"Did you ever think that the middle word of LIFE is IF?\" That whole climactic visit to Brando's fortress in the wilderness lifts the movie out of whatever sense of reality it had earlier carried and places it squarely into the surreal. It's just impossible. A viewer can't tell what consequences any given event will precipitate. There are two beheadings and a buffalo having its head half chopped off by the Bontoc Igorots among whom this film was shot. (Only three generations ago, they hunted heads. I was in graduate school with an Igorot whose grandfather had enjoyed such an enterprise.) <br/><br/>It's about as arty a film as you're likely to see, if art means slowly and relentlessly digging beneath the civilized surface of human culture and uncovering the uncoverable nature of humanity itself, and that's not a pretty picture.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Well, I've watched this movie for over 25 years now and it's still almost as interesting as when I first saw it. It is definitely one of the most unique films ever made.<br/><br/>I still think Martin Sheen got \"dissed\" big-time in the billing, too. He dominates the film yet gets lesser billing than Marlon Brando, who only appears in the last 30 minutes of this 2 hours, 17 minutes film (theatrical version). How unfair is that?<br/><br/>Sheen is fantastic in here, especially his narration, which runs throughout. It's one of the best narrations, if not THE best, I have ever heard in a movie. His voice is just haunting as he relates his thoughts on this incredible, nightmare-like adventure. I never fail to appreciate his work in this movie.<br/><br/>The other thing that strikes me about the film over the years are the number of memorable scenes, ones I have never forgotten, such as......<br/><br/>Sheen losing it in his hotel room in the movie's first scene; Robert Duvall and the totally out-of-place surfing scenes and then the ensuing attack with Wagner's dramatic classical music blaring out of the helicopters; The Playboy bunny entertaining the troops; Frederic Forrest being freaked out seeing a tiger close up in the jungle; the weird scenes on the long riverboat ride; the appearance of hippie journalist Dennis Hopper greeting the crew in Cambodia and then Brando's bizarre character. It goes on and on with strange scenes.<br/><br/>That's not to say I enjoyed everything. No, there are a few very unpleasant scenes, such as the one in which an ox is sliced in half (can't watch that anymore), an innocent family is slaughtered on a small boat by Sheen's young stoned-out crew, and the crew is a little too goofy at times. Then, there is the huge amount of profanity, led by way too many f-words.<br/><br/>So, there is a lot of good and a lot of bad things in this movie for almost anyone who watches this One thing for sure: it is a film you WILL remember!</div>\n",

Spradlin) believe has gone murderer and nut . Willard joins to misfit crew (Albert Hall , Sam Bottons , Frederic Forest, Larry Fishburne) make a risked and dangerous journey up river towards Cambodia . They'll find a mad marine captain (Robert Duval) fond of surf , playboy bunnies and French military and a civil group (Christian Marquand and Aurore Clement) living lonely on a plantation since Dien Bien Phu defeat (1954) . The travel is dangerously developed until the fateful meeting with Kurtz .<br/><br/>Its a stunning and absorbing story that is based on Joseph Conrad novel : ¨the heart of the darkness¨ . The travel is narrated as a surrealist odyssey leading to the dreadful and horrible final but when the protagonists find General Kurtz the scenarios are darkest and gloomiest . Martin Sheen had a heart attack during the filming and some shots of Willard's back are of doubles , including Sheen's brother Joe Estevez who was flown out specially . The storyline by John Milius tackles issues of ethics and morality and the horror war . In 2001 was realized a ¨redux¨ , a new reediting adding footage , the episode of the playmates and the French people encounters , where there are a lot of nudism and is a bit boring but is pretty dialog and little action . This new edition is today considered to be the official version . Originally scheduled to be shot over six weeks , ended up taking 16 months . The movie in spite of the passed time is still powerful and astounding . Colorful cinematography by Vittorio Storaro is spellbound and breathtaking , he won an Oscar , a very well deserved Academy Award . Carmine Coppola musical score and time songs are atmospheric and exceptional . The picture was perfectly directed by Francis Ford Coppola , pacing with great sensitivity and artistic ambition . Rating: Above average . Awesome.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">'This is the end' sings Jim Morrison as choppers criss-cross the screen. No, Jim, it's just the beginning. The beginning of a 202-minute, drug-fuelled Vietnam war epic that follows a group of US soldiers upriver, deep into enemy territory, where they witness madness, come to realise the futility of their conflict, and are reminded of the heart of darkness that beats in all men. And like their mission, it's extremely hard going at times.<br/><br/>Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, this wild '70s classic starts off brilliantly, with war weary Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) being sent on a covert mission to assassinate renegade Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), whose behaviour and methods are proving an embarrassment to the US army. An early set-piece—an air attack on a Vietcong village to the strains of Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries—is hugely impressive, boding well for the rest of the film. The genius continues with Robert Duvall's unforgettable performance as bonkers Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore, while a jungle encounter with a tiger, and a visit by some Playboy playmates to boost moral only add to the fun.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, once the group of soldiers arrive at a French plantation, Apocalypse Now Redux becomes as bloated and unintelligible as its out-of-shape, mumbling star Brando: the action slows down to a snail's pace, and the vast amount of narcotics consumed by cast and crew becomes more than evident, the film turning into a dull psychedelic haze of drug-fuelled weirdness. Dennis Hopper, as a crazed photo journalist, is particularly spaced out, acting like he's single-handedly snorted the entire cocaine supply of the Philippines. This half of the film, as Hopper might say, is a real drag, man.<br/><br/>If I ever decide to watch Apocalypse Now again, which I think is unlikely, I'll be sure to watch the original theatrical version. Many think it is better; even if that isn't the case, it's definitely shorter.<br/><br/>7.5/10 for everything that happens before the plantation scene; 2.5/10 for the rest. So that's an average of 5/10.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Francis Ford Coppola's vision of Vietnam, seeing the eccentricities inherent in the horrors of war and also the indescribable visual beauty running parallel with all the ugliness. Martin Sheen plays an Army Captain who's been traumatized by his first tour of duty in Saigon; but, left without a family and haunted by memories of the jungles, he is almost anxious to accept a new mission: track down and kill a renegade Green Beret Colonel, a poetic martinet who has apparently lost his mind and is hiding out in the \"heart of darkness\". Elephantine production quickly gets out of hand, and Sheen seems to struggle with his wobbly, mushy character (he's rudderless throughout, acting mostly with his wide eyes). The locations and the rock music selections are impeccable, stamping the film with a distinctive (and artistic) mark, but Coppola loses his identity somewhere along this unseemly journey. \"Apocalypse Now\" has the look of genius, yet it could be a picture directed by any number of brazen auteurs. Some incredible supporting performances--including by Marlon Brando, as well as Robert Duvall, Sam Bottoms, Dennis Hopper (who just evaporates) and Frederic Forrest--give the proceedings some muscle, but it's a wayward and occasionally woebegone picture, a war film that throws its punches in the dark like a blindfolded boxer. **1/2 from ****</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Even I find it a bit remarkable that just this week I got around to seeing this movie. I was rummaging through the movies on the shelf at my local public library and found this one on Blu Ray. Of course the picture and sound are both remarkably good, and includes very deep bass in key scenes where it is appropriate.<br/><br/>Two versions of this movie are on the disc, the original 2+ hour version with neither opening nor closing credits. Also the \"redux\" version released a few years ago, it is 3+ hours long. While the basic story is the same in each, the longer version includes a couple of scenes cut from the original. Neither of them affect the main story.<br/><br/>The main story is about a rogue military leader in the late 1960s, in a good performance Marlon Brando is Colonel Walter E. Kurtz. He has ended up somewhere in Cambodia and off the radar. He is accused of killings that may or may not be justified in the context of the Vietnam war.<br/><br/>In an equally good performance is Martin Sheen as expert assassin Captain Benjamin L. Willard. he is called in specifically to do a covert mission, if caught he was never sent, to find Kurtz and \"terminate his command\", which really meant to assassinate him.<br/><br/>To do this a small crew with a small boat are assigned to him, and they head out not knowing for sure when and where they would end up.<br/><br/>What makes this movie so striking are the makeup and cinematography which take the acting of Brando and Sheen up to another level. My only gripe with the movie is how they made so many of the military guys seem like frat boys using bad judgment and acting stupid. I am Vietnam war age, I knew several who went and served and to me it disrespects all the thousands who went and did not act like stupid frat boys.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Apocalypse Now is not only my personal favorite work by Francis Ford Coppolla, it's also one of the great visions ever put onto cinema. It makes what was horrific, strange, and ironically exciting and mysterious about the Vietnam War into this mad tale of obsession, death, loss, and the dark side of humanity. While the stories behind the production of the film made it notorious and rather risky back in 1979, it works on its own terms and represents not just Coppola's genius but others in the Zoetrope team as well. It also paints a sometimes lurid, ultra-violent, bleak and curious view of what war does to people, both in the lower ranks, the big-guns, and those who go too far \"up the river\".<br/><br/>Many have also been perplexed by Marlon Brando's performance in the film, but it's actually one of his very best turns on screen, albeit improvised and close to running off the rails. His few moments on screen (even in the somewhat unnecessary scene plopped into the Redux version) there's enough conviction in what he's saying- and what perhaps isn't said- that makes the trip down the river worthwhile on an intellectual and poetic level. And making up the bulk of the film are delirious turns by Robert Duvall (a Oscar nominated turn he should've won), Martin Sheen as the Captain with almost too much to ponder in an ever increasing state of everything but him being insane; character actors like Sam Bottoms, Frederic Forrest and 14 year-old Laurence Fishburne have some of the best work they've ever done. And it goes without saying that Dennis Hopper comes close to stealing any scene he's in, for better or worse, with the most to say in rambling, yet coherent words.<br/><br/>Every time I watch this film (and mostly the original version which is what first drew me in completely as opposed to the very good if muddled Redux version) I am astounded with how operatic everything is, and how the variations on the madness and chaos of Vietnam is put together. Of course one can give adulation to Coppola for this as he completed it without totally going off the deep end or possibly dying, and his talents are pulled to their richest peaks here as a storyteller and director of actors. But it can't be said enough how much I can't get enough of Vittorio Storaro's cinematography, which has in part come close to perfect for this kind of epic film. The music is perfectly eerie and insidious, with the Doors song used for one of my favorite iconic scenes in the movies (both of them). Walter Murch's editing- which apparently was what saved the film from being a four-hour disaster- makes the action move when it needs to and for individual shots to get their due. And even the production design is remarkable and, to the extent it goes to, original in its partial translation of both Conrad's fiction and the unfortunate realities of life on the river.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it yet, in short, get off your ass and get a copy; it might cause a kind of shell-shock for a viewer after first taking it all in, but it has some of the purest, most rewarding bits of cinema ever to come out of that all-too-brief American new-wave of the 1970's.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">APOCALYPSE NOW REDUX(2001)features forty-nine minutes added to Francis Ford Coppola's surreal Vietnam epic. A dillusional, but loyal and steadfast Capt. Willard(Martin Sheen)accepts a classified mission to terminate Col. Walter Kurtz(Marlon Brando), who is a loose cannon that has strayed from the program. Kurtz is not of sound mind or deed and has crossed over into Cambodia where he reigns God-like over a renegade outpost. Coppola succeeds in presenting his highly ambitious depiction of the disturbing horrors of war. Not only are Brando and Sheen excellent; Robert Duvall is in top form in his short screen time. Other notable cast members are: Frederic Forrest and Dennis Hopper. Scott Glenn, G.D. Spradlin, Harrison Ford and R. Lee Ermey all have minor roles. Sam Bottoms and a young Laurence Fishburne are cardboard and pedestrian. Carmine and Francis Coppola are responsible for the majority of the brilliantly eerie soundtrack that also features The Doors and Flash Cadillac. I can't really explain how the best can actually get better; but you owe it to yourself to see the expanded version of this masterpiece.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>Much has been made of the personal risks taken by this filmmaker and crew, and the mapping to the metaphor of war:<br/><br/>Coppola, already rich and famous for the lush but pointless `Godfather' films, reaches into his soul and decides to risk it to do something important. He deliberately chooses Conrad's metaphor of personal journey, and creates a multi-layered structure: the sense of Man in society; the `reason' of War, colonial wars and the specifics of Vietnam; the meeting of darkness of self at the end of the hero's journey; and at the lowest layer, Coppola's own quest for import as an artist.<br/><br/>When I saw this over a couple decades back, I thought it a failure: earnestness does not equal art; commitment does not deliver skill; Italian passion outraces German nihilism.<br/><br/>But now, with the `restored' footage, I have a completely different take. I still think it a failure overall, but with some powerful images. As with the Doors, its aspirations were too large for the ability, the vision too grand for the reach. But now with the passage of time, the metaphor has had a polar switch.<br/><br/>Twenty years ago, the War was a simple affair: confusing at the bristles, jaded selfishness at the handle. With the passage of time as we learn more, the War has `become' incredibly more complex and unfathomable. Now with the film: it started life as huge, unfocused mess. Over a long period, with radical paring and the addition of a very competent framework of sound, something resulted. Unfocused still, but powerful enough to engage. Over time and repeated viewings, this work has been overgrown by personal probings, and integrated into the imaginative landscape like an incompetent building becoming a fond element of the cityscape. So as the war becomes less pegged in our minds, this film becomes more comprehensible, more whole.<br/><br/>With repeated personal handling, this film has become `true.' Think of this: it now has such a clear center that the filmmaker can `enhance' that message. It is now so coherent, it begs for addition. And the three main additions are so, so very apt and self-referential:<br/><br/>-- The French plantation takes its reason to be from the mere fact that it has been. That is precisely what this film has become: a colonizer of our minds that now makes its own sense to be there.<br/><br/>-- The playmates. Sex -- even exploitative sex -- domesticates.<br/><br/>\n",
      "-- The extra exposure of Brando. Here was a tiger, a man whose presence tore through our minds, who changed the world, who mesmerized. He went down his own personal river before this film and was defeated. Here he shows up in a character who is precisely the actor (with a wildeyed acolyte Hopper similarly spanning fiction and reality). Wasn't clear when the film was new, but is now. These are not the winners we see, but the losers. The horror.<br/><br/>To prepare for this redux, I watched the three `Wallace and Gromit' films. Here also was a personal vision, explored at first with extreme commitment, at high cost in the face of detractors. Working by himself for 7 years produced the first film. It was shockingly weird. The second (and probably the best) was a low-budget collaboration with one other monk. As with `Apocalypse,' this film invented itself, by charm insinuated itself into the familiar as if God had put it there all along. Then by the third film, with scores of people, the magic is transformed to cultural momentum.<br/><br/>But there is hope: `Apocalypse' hangs on the War, and though that metaphoric connection is severed, it still stays on the shelf we first placed it: as a war movie. And there are other war movies. And since films are seldom about reality and instead about other films, we can rely on others to give us distance from this foreign invader. Two very much more skilled filmmakers in particular: Kubrick and Malick. Rely on them.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Apocalypse Now is directed by Francis Ford Coppola who also co-adapts the screenplay with John Milius from Heart of Darkness written by Joseph Conrad. It stars Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Laurence Fishburne, Dennis Hopper, Harrison Ford, Frederic Forrest, Sam Bottoms and Albert Hall. Cinematography is by Vittorio Storaro and the music is primarily arranged by Carmine Coppola.<br/><br/>The Vietnam War and Captain Benjamin L. Willard (Sheen) is approached by American intelligence to go on a secret assignment: he's to follow the Nung River into the remote Cambodian jungle to find and assassinate Colonel Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a member of the US Army Special Forces who has gone insane.<br/><br/>One of the most talked and written about films of all time, Apocalypse Now remains to this day a harrowing and haunting experience to first time viewers. With a production shoot that has in itself become legendary, Coppola's flawed masterpiece has been dissected and argued over to within an inch of its magnificent life. People will continue to write about it for ever more it seems, perhaps there might even be the odd new confrontational spin on what resides within? But ultimately it's what the individual takes away from the film that matters, our own interpretations key to the enjoyment of such a disturbing vision of war and violence.<br/><br/>Many of the set-pieces, dialogue and characters have long since passed into folklore, and rightly so. The Ride of the Valkyries helicopter assault, Kurtz's surreal death camp, the boat people massacre, purple haze, the playmates, Kilgore, and of course the horror, the horror..indeed. The performances match the quality of Storaro's sumptuous Philippines photography, Sheen is fiercely committed and Duvall and Hopper in turn are powerhouse and edgy. While Brando, doing his own bizzaro thing in the last third, brings a little chaos unintentionally in keeping with the madness at the heart of this particular darkness.<br/><br/>Personally that last draggy third does stop it from being a complete genius type whole, but everything up to it is so damn good it's arguably churlish to expect perfection? But as near perfection movies go, Apocalypse Now proudly sits with the best of them, sitting there with a harrowed look upon its face. 9/10</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Considering that Adam Sandler was young and inexperienced, I guess you can't fault him too much for appearing in this terrible film. The amazing thing, however, is that this didn't kill his career once and for all! Why is this film so bad? Well, the biggest problem is that it's supposed to be a comedy but it's amazingly unfunny. The story is about a guy who wants to be a stand-up comedian and features a supposedly professional comic in the film as well--yet there wasn't a single funny line in the film. It was as if they'd asked Mr. Spock or a robot to write the jokes. Additionally, the rest of the film is written so very poorly that there really isn't anything to recommend the story...nothing.<br/><br/>The film is set on a somewhat dilapidated cruise ship. Adam Sandler is a lowly waiter and puts up with lots of abuse from everyone. Frankly, no one is this mistreated on any job and it's hard to find anyone who is a bigger loser than this character. He's just so pathetic that it makes you cringe. At the same time, he looks up to a comic on board the ship that has less charisma and charm than any undertaker! The guy is so obnoxious and untalented that you are left wondering if this guy could get a real job on this planet or only in bad films like this. The answer is actually pretty obvious. I was surprised at this character, actually, as I don't think I've ever heard a character from the 1980s that curses and much or as colorfully as this guy...and yet we are expected to believe he actually gets paid to talk?! As for the rest of the cast, it's mostly a bunch of beauty pageant contestants, though you wonder WHAT sort of pageant this is. That's because some sport sashes that have the names of states or cities and some have sashes with names of countries--but often the women have no accent and look like they can't even spell the names of the countries, let alone having come from there. The best example is the blonde lady who has a typical American accent...and she's Miss Jamaica!? Additionally, the ladies have no charisma or personalities--they are just eye candy--just bodies to jiggle past the screen.<br/><br/>So, we have semi-sexy beauty queens and comedians who are about as funny as hemorrhoids--this is NOT a recipe for a good film! About the only thing even halfway likable is Sandler. He's unfunny but seems like a nice young man...a horribly stereotypically Jewish young man saddled with the awful name \"Shecky Moskowitz\". Wow, that was subtle!! The only other positive thing I can say about this film is that it makes you forget some of Sandler's other bombs, such as LITTLE NICKY. Oh, and if you are wondering, I did really enjoy many of his films (such as REIGN ON ME, WATERBOY and THE WEDDING SINGER). I just marvel, however, at how indiscriminate he is in his choices of film projects.<br/><br/>Giving a film a 1, for me, is reserved for films such as those of Hershell Gordon Lewis, Ed Wood, Al Adamson, Ted Mikels and the like. I don't give this score out routinely but I do think this film also deserves this score, as it is unlikable, cheap and stupid from start to finish and it's obvious why this film is currently ranked within the 100 worst films of all time on IMDb.</div>\n",

Was it the camera angles, and I have to say this film had some of the most awkward and cheaply placed camera angles I've seen in any film? <br/><br/>Was it the immature and painfully unfunny humour, down to the juvenile dialogue and jokes that make you cringe so much your face is aching still after watching the film? Was it the broken and predictable structure of the story? <br/><br/>Or was it Adam Sandler's truly irritating performance, that makes his performances in Jack and Jill, Little Nicky and You Don't Mess With the Zohan seem award-worthy in comparison? Or the wasted, and I mean wasted, talents of Billy Bob Thornton? Or even the single most unlikeable and obnoxious characters of any film to have Sandler starring in it? <br/><br/>Hard to decide, seeing as everything was as bad as the other. All in all, I had heard Going Overboard was bad, but I wasn't expecting it to be THIS bad! 0/10 Bethany Cox</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I realize after the several dozen Adam Sandler movies I've seen that he is an acquired taste, and for the most part, I've enjoyed his movies and rated them accordingly for their watchability. This one ranks as the very least watchable and as one that I wouldn't mind seeing every print \"accidentally\" destroyed. It's a good thing that it was instantly forgotten, otherwise we wouldn't have his more watchable films, particularly the nearly half dozen he's done up to this point with Drew Barrymore.<br/><br/>As a waiter aboard a huge cruise ship, all he does is comment on the various shipboard entertainers while desperately seeking his own chance at becoming a stand up comic. The shipboard comic is completely unfunny, having a laugh that instantly makes you want to reach through the screen and push him overboard, or in my case wishing that a giant shark would suddenly jump up and swallow him whole.<br/><br/>Then there's the crude rock singer, a man with as much talent as a drum with a hole in it. He gets a bunch of disgusting moments with various groupees, eye rollingly hideous and embarrassing. The women themselves whom Sandler keeps getting rejected by get their own big introduction, and they are as funny as the worries of what happens to a piece of hard candy when swallowed whole. A 24 hour marathon of \"Out to Sea\" would provide more laughs than this. Sandler is rather cute in his debut, but 30+ years later, there should be a warning with him speaking that encourages the viewer to bypass this one and head directly to \"Mixed Nuts*.</div>\n",

His cross-dressing California friend Tom Hodges (as Bob) thinks Mr. Sandler is funny. With movies like this, it's good to have friends like that. Sandler would like to replace snickering Scott LaRose (as Dickie Diamond), the boat's official stand-up comedian. Also on bored (sic) is mellow \"Yellow Teeth\" rock star Adam Rifkin (as Croaker), a bunch of beauty contestants in skimpy bathing suits, and a gang of card-carrying members of the SAG. Sandler also gets help from legendary comedian and joke thief Milton Berle, who cleverly unloads a few of his worst acquisitions on the unsuspecting upstart...<br/><br/>** Going Overboard (3/89) Valerie Breiman ~ Adam Sandler, Tom Hodges, Scott LaRose, Adam Rifkin</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Adam's warning in the beginning of Going Overboard on not to expect anything good or any budget should actually be a disclaimer for all his movies.<br/><br/>Actually, that's just my personal opinion on how I really cannot stand Adam Sandler. Sure, there are many – millions? – that do adore him and more power to them. And I could easily suggest they watch this movie to prove my point on how incredibly untalented, unfunny and dumb this lucky sob is. But",
      "in Sandler's defense (GULP,) anyone could have a shaky start such as this one. So, while this disaster of a film isn't really proof of much",
      "it is a hint of what his movies will eventually become.<br/><br/>I came home one night from work nearly two months ago – yeah, it's taken me awhile to finally write this – and all I wanted to do was watch an incredibly bad movie to laugh at and not with. Normally, I wouldn't select a Sandler film – they're typically so bad, my mouth is agape more than anything else, but when I learned of both the viewer rating on this (which is currently at 1.9/10 stars) and that it was his first film, I had to see it.<br/><br/>This movie disgusted me more than made me laugh. Still, to this day, it's like sh|t is still on my clothes that I cannot discard and I am powerless to that awful smell. I am not kidding: this movie is that bad.<br/><br/>It didn't help that the movie started off with the vilest of cartoon intros. If I was able to post pictures in this review, I would provide you with proof of how insane, repulsive and gross they are. And I am not talking about potty humor or body parts. I am speaking of poorly drawn cartoons of Sandler's dumb facial expressions.<br/><br/>Had the rest of the movie continued as an animated feature with that cartoon caricature of Sandler, I surely would've turned off the movie. Well, I should've anyways, because it didn't get better.<br/><br/>Yeah, the budget seemed like it was at near zero and Sandler, himself, warns us of there being no money, but the lack of any talent from anyone behind the camera, in front of it or even holding it is more disturbing to me than the money fronted to make this happen.<br/><br/>Basically, and I am giving the plot too much credit with that word, Adam's jealous of another \"funny man\" on a cruise ship and spends most of the movie daydreaming his way into the spotlight.<br/><br/>Nothing works here. Not a single line, not a single \"joke,\" not a single frame. I would say the movie was written by preteen boys with their horny minds, but even they would find this movie in offensively bad taste.<br/><br/>Sure, I despise Sandler's work. This wasn't going to change my mind one way or another. But, nothing, NOTHING, could've prepared me for this train wreck of absolute garbage.<br/><br/>* * * Final thoughts: #1 this movie came out in 1989",
      "in the SUMMER season. Why couldn't this have pushed his future career overboard?? #2, it *did* have a budget. Of $200,000. If you dare, and I highly recommend you don't, please, PLEASE, tell me where any of that was spent. #3, this doesn't even fit in the \"so bad, it's good\" category. You can watch any of the most recent Sandler movies for that category. Say, the past two decades worth of this films.</div>\n",

The situation was utterly ridiculous and the lines were so unfunny I actually felt sad for the actors. Perhaps it was my VCR that made the picture of the film look sloppy but it seemed like it was filmed as a high school project rather than by professional adults. <br/><br/>I was glad when I saw the review of others that I was not alone in panning this film.

Had previously watched bits and pieces of this film years ago (but never finishing) while now having watched the film in its entirety.<br/><br/>What makes the film bad are the effects, the acting, the lack of an interesting plot, and the overall jokes.<br/><br/>Sandler's character is likable as the lead but tries too hard to make the audience laugh (this film has a feel that it isn't really a film with Sandler speaking to the audience and looking at the camera as in \"breaking the fourth wall\").<br/><br/>Just about everything about the film is terrible but that was expected. Too cheesy and not in a \"so bad it's good\" kind of way.<br/><br/>Also the character of Dickie Diamond (the main comedian in the cruise) was far obnoxious and wasn't funny in the slightest, with spilling out far many F-bombs, and it got progressively more as the film goes on.<br/><br/>Although he was slightly entertaining and the film goes downhill when the guests think he died because his hat went overboard in the sea. Though his character gets locked in the bathroom (which made no sense as to why a public cruise would have a bathroom door being locked from the outside, and supposedly no guest or crew member had to use it- as it appeared hours had passed). And isn't he familiar with the cruise ship- wouldn't he have known? It made very little sense.<br/><br/>Then when the terrorists arrive (again trying far too hard for laughs as it came across as just pathetic).<br/><br/>Nothing more to be said about this film that hasn't been already. One of the worst films ever seen but given its budget, perhaps shouldn't be considered as such.<br/><br/>Even if you are a fan of Adam Sandler and may want to give this film a try, be warned as it is terrible- it makes Jack and Jill look Oscar worthy.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">With Adam Sandler.<br/><br/>This is without a doubt one of the most idiotic films ever made. It's about cruise ship waiter Shecky (Sandler) wanting to be a comedian on the cruise ship. First off, there is not one funny or clever line in the entire movie honestly. It is so unfunny it's pathetic. There is surprisingly not much crude or sexual humor, but the f-word is plentiful. The budget is really low, and that also ruins the film. It takes place on a cruise ship, but it seems they only had money to rent out a small boat and only had money for 10 ship extras, one of which is Billy Bob Thornton. The opening credits are animated reeeeeaally cheaply, and it is just pathetic. I hate this movie and everyone else that sees this will hate it too.<br/><br/>86 mins. rated R for Language.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I am going to offer a statement up front as a prologue for this review- I like Adam Sandler. I am a fan of his work, both comedic and dramatic. I always make an effort to see his films. In addition to supplying me with laughs, he also offers the occasional deep and moving performance in his serious work. So I am not coming into this review as a hater by any means. I just wanted to say that.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler's first film, \"Going Overboard\", was a 1989 release, directed by Valerie Breiman. It follows the lead, Shecky Moskowitz (Sandler), a struggling comedian working on a cruise ship. It is notable for its quiet release, and the fact that a whole lot of people don't know about its existence. It is also notable for it's exceptionally poor quality (being on IMDb's Bottom 100 list), and at times painfully unfunny jokes. I tried to watch this film twice before today. Once by myself- in an effort that ended after less than 10 minutes. And a second time yesterday with two friends, this time making it 15 minutes in.<br/><br/>And today, while writing this review, I forced myself to watch even more of this flick, in an attempt to make it at least one third of the way through, so I can be more fair and just with my analysis.<br/><br/>The film is sloppily put together. For some reason, Shecky almost constantly breaks the fourth wall, and speaks to the audience. Now, this is a technique that can work if utilized properly, but here, it seems forced and contrived, and it never really adds to the proceedings. In fact, it makes almost no sense whatsoever. They attempt to expand this idea, with other characters (such as his best friend) noticing the \"camera\", or having other passengers (notably beauty queens on the ship) appear randomly to talk to the camera, but it doesn't feel natural. <br/><br/>The comedy is extremely unfunny. An opening scene featuring Burt Young (how they got him in the movie is beyond me) makes an unfunny attempt at using porno-titles etched on the sides of video tapes for cheap laughs in a gag that is DOA. A barely animated opening title sequence tries to solicit laughs using a caricature of Sandler, but it fails miserably. Much of the humor is too drawn out, or too brief. And many of the gags fall flat as a pancake. An example that pops into my mind is a scene where we, for no reason, see the \"villainous\" character dancing on the deck in front of some sunbathing women for about a full minute while snazzy music plays in the background. It made no sense, yet looked like it was trying to play for laughs. I didn't laugh once. The most creative gag was Shecky giving a Bloody Mary to a patron which had been soiled by a seagull's excrement... and it wasn't even funny, just gross.<br/><br/>The acting is uniformly abysmal, with Sandler alternating between trying way too hard in one scene, to looking bored and just reading his lines in the next. His rival, \"Dickie Diamond\" is portrayed as a lewd and vulgar comedian, and he's meant to come across as a bully that you hate, but the performance doesn't work, and makes you pity him and feel as though he may be handicapped in some way.<br/><br/>The direction is unsuitable, and the film can't even muster the quality of a 70's television commercial in terms of visual aesthetics. (I have read that due to an error, the film had to be shot without vital lens and filter packs, which the crew had forgot, hence it's flat and cheap look.) There is no discernible story by any stretch of the imagination- reading a synopsis elsewhere, it is suggested that terrorists, thugs and other assorted villains will raid the ship later on in the film, but I can't see how or why. Literally nothing happened in the half hour or so I saw. The film has no guidance. The editing is also bad all around, and despite moving very quickly, it drags and drags... it's jarring yet also boring... It feels like snippets of a few dozen different skits strung together, with all of the punchlines removed. There's no flow, and nothing seems to make any sense, or contribute to any real effort at a story.<br/><br/>Really, as much as it pains me to say this... this is the first movie I've encountered that I have been unable to sit through. It's literally painful to watch.<br/><br/>I have to give this a 1 out of 10, and that's coming from a Sandler fan. It isn't the worst movie ever made... but it's up (or rather, down) there.<br/><br/>EDIT: (June 8th) I have watched another half hour of the film. My review still stands as is.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Even if you're a huge Sandler fan, please don't bother with this extremely disappointing comedy!  I bought this movie for $7.99, assuming it has to be at least halfway decent since my man Sandler is in it and because I assumed some women would get naked (judging by the R-rating and scantily-clad women on the cover).  Well, there are quite a few scantily-clad women, but none get naked.  I'm not sure what point this was in Sandler's career, but I'm guessing it was even before his SNL days.  I can be wrong.  This is like watching one of his home movies.  He might look back at a cheesy movie like this and reminisce about the good ol' times...but we (the audience) are left to dry.  This is hardly a \"movie\"!  Sandler does a lot of talking to the camera, and even admits at one point that this is \"no-budget\" movie (that's right, not a low-budget movie, a NO-budget movie).  So our job is pretty much to laugh AT the quirky characters.  There is no steady plot, it's like an extended sketch comedy show--but a crude and badly written one.  That guy who played the nasty comedian was completely annoying and it was implausible in the first place that he would receive such a mass audience.  And Sandler finds his comic inspiration by saying the one classic Henny Youngman line \"Take my wife, please\" and the audience is on the floor?  I'm not even going to TRY to make any logic here.  Sure, Sandler's current and recent movies are not known for making a lot of sense (the penguin in \"Billy Madison,\" the midget in \"Happy Gilmore's\" Happy Place) but the comedy works.  This is a strictly amateurish work, and even if you're curious about Adam's early days in film--you still won't be interested.  You're better off checking out his start on SNL or maybe his underrated role in \"Mixed Nuts.\"  Of course, the Sandman is not the only actor wasted in this thankless vehicle.  Billy Bob Thornton also makes a short appearance, Billy Zane (\"Titanic\") has a supporting role and the great Burt Young (from the \"Rocky\" movies) has a significant role.  <br/><br/>This awful comedy will most probably be collecting dust on the 99-cent rental section of your local video store--and rightfully so. <br/><br/>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I always wanted to watch this movie because it's considered by many one of the worst movies of all time, it always sat in the Bottom 100 (the list of the 100 worst movies of all time) and it's also known as Adam Sandler's debut (and I personally liked most of Sandler's movies). And sometimes I like to watch a terrible movie just for laughing at his inanity. But unfortunately, this was NOT the case. This movie really bored me to the point that I wanted to left it, but since it's not fair to dish a movie entirely after leaving it, I stuck with it.<br/><br/>The movie is set on a cruise ship. Adam Sandler plays a lowly waiter and is badly treated by almost everyone. This already makes the viewer sad and it makes you wonder if there are any other characters that suffer this type of abuses (even in real life). At the same time he is envious of a comedian that works on the ship that is painfully unfunny (and I am not joking, he looks even WORSE than Larry the Cable Guy) and it makes you wonder if the guy was crass and obnoxious just on purpose. As for the other members of the cast, we have Burt Young as a general that watches the movie on his TV, Billy Zane as King Neptune, a pointless bit role by a then-unknown Billy Bob Thornton and various beauty pageants with the same amount of personality of a door-knob!<br/><br/>So, the movie consists of comedians so unfunny that you'll rather hear dogs barking Jingle Bells for a year straight, paper-thin plot, and semi-naked ladies that pass on the screen from time to time. This makes it for one of the dullest movies of all time. But at least this proves that debuting with a God-awful movie doesn't necessarily destroy your career. Adam Sandler debuted with this and he managed to star in good movies such as 50 FIRST DATES, BIG DADDY and CLICK; tho he has also other bombs in his career such as JACK AND JILL (now in the Bottom 100), GROWN UPS 2 and THE RIDICOLOUS SIX.<br/><br/>However, I knew that GOING OVERBOARD was bad, but I wasn't expecting THIS level of awfulness! This movie truly deserves all the hate since is cheaply made (with camera work so shoddy that it can give you a migraine), boring, badly acted and unfunny. It's no surprise that this movie has a score of 1,8 and it's among the lowest rated movies on IMDB.</div>\n",

His first movie, \"Going Overboard,\" may appear to be bad to the average Joe person. But not for die-hard Adam Sandler fans! This is one of those \"So Bad It's Good\" movies that keeps every movie person glued to the television set! Also, who (refering to us guys) doesn't like the ladies, huh? So the next time you're at that store where you're greeted by an old person in a blue vest, and you need your laundry stuff, cheap clothes, Doritos and Coca-Cola, and a cheap boom box, don't forget to dig into that $5 bin and find this movie! It'll make you prepared for more of his movies, like \"Billy Madison\" and \"Happy Gilmore\" (or should I say \"Happy Madison?\")</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Ok now this was Adam Sandlers First FILM. I am a Giant Film Lover. I Loved this 80s Masterpiece why? It was Made CRAPPY ON PURPOSE LOL. I Loved how Adam kept looking at the Camera and just Talking with it. It was kind of like he was making a documentary on becoming a Stand up Comedian. I also Loved the Cast it had so many Big Stars in the Film. In the one part he had an interview with One of the Greatest Comedians of all time Milton need I say more. He was only in it for about 5 minutes. Giving him a few Old Time Classic Jokes with NO SWEARING YOU KNOW THE \"F WORD'S\". Just Showing him you can still make people Laugh with CLEAN JOKE'S. I Have No Idea how this Film got such a BAD RATING. IT kind of Sucks that it did why. Because when you see such a Bad Rating. You kind of put off Watchung it for the Longest Times. But in the Last Year or Two with my REAL LOVE FOR FILM'S. I don't look at the RATINGS ANYMORE. I JUST MADE A GIANT LIST OF FILM'S THAT I WANTED TO WATCH FOR YEAR'S. 90 Percent of the Time the Film's with such a BAD RATING. Turns out to Be such a Great FILM. Like this one a 1.8 REALLY COME ON EVERYONE. Just take a Big look at what the FILM'S are really about before you watch it. This was Adam's First FILM. Before that he did 4 Episodes of The Cosby Show. In his First Film he Pretty much talked to the Camera without smiling. Oh the Best Part Tons of HOT CHICKS. Oh and the Tital of the FILM GOING OVERBOARD kind of fit in Perfect. The Whole Film was on a Fancy Boat.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Going Overboard may not be Adam Sandler's best work since becoming an actor, but this movie isn't all that bad. It can get sort of cheesy at points and does kind of suck in the long run, but this isn't as bad as I've heard people comment about it on here. I mean this movie isn't the best movie in the world, that's why I didn't rate it higher than 5, but it does deliver some funny moments and turned out to be a decent comedy. I even have to say that this is better than some of the stupid comedies that have come out recently. So to all the naysayers just hear me out, Going Overboard isn't as bad as you make it out to be sometimes.<br/><br/>5/10</div>\n",

I popped this DVD in, and to my surprise, I did not laugh once. I though it was kind of suspicious it was on the one dollar shelf. I thought it might just be because this movie's old, but after watching it, I found my real answer. I mean, who in their right mind watches this stuff? Sandler plays Schecky Moskowitz, an obnoxious, unfunny comedian. He decides to take a job as a waiter on a cruise ship. The thing in which Sandler talks to the screen, and explains what's going on in the movie, including him saying the only reason they made this movie was because they had access to a big boat and gorgeous babes does not score one laugh. I wouldn't be surprised if that was actually the only reason they made it. No one in their right mind would make this. No actor, no matter how bad they are, no one involved with this film, no matter how bad they are would read this script and think the movie's actually worth making. Adam Sandler's first film, and by far his weakest.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"content\">\n",
      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">\"Going Overboard\" is a comedy that is part campy, part raunchy, a tad bit exploitative, and completely unfunny. It has the distinction of being Adam Sandler's first film ever, not just his first film where he had the leading role. Unfortunately, it is also Sandler's worst film.<br/><br/>The only reason you would probably know about this movie is because it received a very wide video release in the mid 1990's, after Sandler had become a breakout star of \"Saturday Night Live\". Today, even though his current movies haven't received the greatest of reviews, he's still a bona-fide movie star, and among the most successful former SNL stars in the show's history. This movie shows, however, that at the age of 22, he still had some work to do.<br/><br/>If there's any reason to sit through this 97-minute movie that feels a hell of a lot longer, it's to see how Sandler started out as a young, struggling comedian. He obviously took his prior experiences in bombing in clubs, and made his character, Schecky Moskowitz, who is probably not all that different from Sandler himself, a bit more poignant.<br/><br/>However, the rest of the film is draggy, uneven, and really unfunny. The story is scattered and one-dimensional, the subplots feel contrived and out of place, and almost everyone in this movie seems as though they try way too hard for a laugh, including Sandler. In fact, it makes no sense that Sandler's character, as a cruise ship waiter, envies the cruise's comedian, Dickie Diamond (Scott LaRose), when he isn't really all that funny.<br/><br/>The only really good scene is when Sandler, struggling to make his cruise audience laugh, spontaneously meets Milton Berle, who plays himself. I also liked the addition of a laughing track when Berle told his jokes. Ironically enough, it seemed as though the movie did not try as hard to make you laugh when the laughing track played.<br/><br/>The only other big star the movie managed to get at the time was Burt Young, who plays General Noriega from a country in central America despite not looking Hispanic at all. It's also obvious that his scenes were shot long after the filming on a cruise ship was complete.<br/><br/>There are also some appearances in this movie from then-unknown actors who made it big later, such as Peter Berg, Billy Zane, and (perhaps most surprising) Billy Bob Thornton. Fortunately, they would go on to do bigger and better movies.<br/><br/>If there is only one reason to see \"Going Overboard\", it's to show that when it comes to show business, especially comedy, you have to start somewhere. Sandler still had a long way to go in finding his comedic persona. Fortunately, he still comes off as likable in this movie. It's just too bad that the rest of the film could not quite catch up.<br/><br/>So \"Going Overboard\" is a big miss. Its story and its comedy needed some major work. It being a \"no-budget\" movie, as Sandler puts it in the beginning when he breaks the fourth wall, is no excuse.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Now, I personally do not think this movie is that bad and I certainly do not think that it deserves the bottom 100, I mean High School Musical is not in there and that is the biggest load of S@#&amp; I have ever seen and I am not joking. Now, the film is about Stanley Marokitzadana or something and him trying to become a famous comedian on a cruise. The movie is particularly funny every noun and then and the jokes that are not hilarious are just funny and sadly some were not funny at all but it does not matter cause their funny jokes are more often. I think Adam Sandler did a very good job as the waiter and the bit where the plot gets so out of hand is just so damn funny ( last 5 minutes) and the bit where he is explaining how the earthquake cost them no money was also in the good jokes section. Also the terrorists are funny as well but sadly do not play a huge part in this funny, funny film. Overall fans of Adam Sandler will enjoy this film as it is first movie and you can really see how he became as funny as he is. I rate this film 54% for keeping me amused while being pretty hit and miss. So grab some mates and grab some beers and just watch a good movie starring Adam Sandler as his good old self. GO ADAM SANDLER AND THE WHOLE CREW IN THIS GREAT FILM YOU GUYS ROCK. Also to those out there who do not like this movie I think it is because you were expecting too much out of Adam Sandler's first movie cause in my opinion it is not as good as his other stuff but is definitely better then a lot of other comedy's out there and I even think it is funnier then Click ( not really but probably 3 quarters there. Thats my 2 cents from LacTheBod. I do not know maybe one day this will be respected as it is meant to be, as a comedy just made to introduce Adam Sandler to it's expecting audience. If you did not like this you have to high a standards as it is better then some new movies out there.</div>\n",

Stand up comedy is rarely funny unless the comedian really knows what he is doing. This film contains two of them, and they definitely o not know what they are doing. One is unfunny and offensive and the other (Adam Sandler) is just plain unfunny. <br/><br/>Except for the worthless stand up comedy, Sandler also spends quite a lot of time talking directly to the camera, whining about this and that, which I guess is supposed to be some kind of fourth wall joke, but it is extremely annoying.<br/><br/>Oh, and don't forget the bikini girls with 80's hair who are there as some kind of filler material when there is nothing unfunny or annoying to see. I like pretty girls in bikinis just as much as the next guy, but I really dislike it when they are put in a film without having any sort of purpose. Fill your film with worthwhile substance and let me look at bikini girls in my own time thank you very much.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Synopsis: An aspiring comic who also happens to be an idiot, gets a job on a cruise ship and interacts with unhilarious results with the ship's crew and guests.<br/><br/>The Review: Damn that untalented hack! What's his name? Oh yeah, Adam Sandler, bet you we'll never see him again.<br/><br/>Of course I'm being incredibly sarcastic. This is probably as forgettable a movie as Sandler would liken it to be, by playing an idiot on one of those Cinemax late night T &amp; A films (without the actual T&amp;A) that's hokey and completely crappy. I was dumb enough to blow the money on seeing this movie, based on a perverse curiosity to see the Sandman because I knew the film would be awful, to what extent I had no idea. There's nothing worse than seeing future stars like Billy Bob Thornton and Billy Zane appear in this piece of crap as well. Completely low budget and devoid of comedy, \"Going Overboard\" is going to the bottom of the sea, where it deserves to be. But of course, that'd probably be polluting the Earth.</div>\n",

For some strange reason, most of his film projects are just bad films. This one is just the worse. In fact, it's actually abusive in it's awfulness.The fact that Going Overboard actually secured a distributor and was released into movie theaters is an astonishment. Think about it, people actually paid hard earned money going to see this movie and be entertained and instead found themselves watching this. It's almost a criminal offense it's so very, very bad! And make no mistake, I do not mean so bad that it's actually good. I mean this film is just not an engaging entertainment. <br/><br/>DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS MOVIE!!!There, I have warned you! By the way,I don't know why Adam Sandler is now a multi millionaire making film after film and that are all so lukewarm.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Many popular actors appeared in a lot of crap up until they had a breakthrough film that made them stars. Sylvester Stallone made porn as well as \"Death Race 2000\" before making it big with \"Rocky\". George Clooney made \"Grizzly II: The Concert\". Johnny Depp starred in \"A Nightmare on Elmstreet\". And, Renée Zellweger and Matthew McConaughey both starred in \"The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre\"...a film that is currently #45 on the IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List--the 100 worst rated major release movies of all time.<br/><br/>In this film, the normally cute and very pretty Zellweger plays a ridiculous nerd. How do you know she's a nerd? She never washes her hair and wears dorky glasses. Why she would hang out on prom night with the vacuous and nasty 'popular couple' makes little sense....and everyone seemed more like caricatures than real people. Plus, anyone...even a super-dork...would wash their hair when going to prom. As for McConaughey, he plays a redneck serial killer...and actually is much more believable than the rest. Little do any of them know that far worse awaits them.<br/><br/>So is the film any good despite being on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List? No. Many of the characters make no sense (such as the lady who flashes her breasts out the window and whose dialog was written by a groundhog) and the film seems like it was made for folks who find the \"Friday the 13th\" franchise too intellectually taxing. Bad acting, bad direction, ultra-violence and a script that simply is an excuse to see teens butchered...this one is simply a bad film from start to finish. But it's also proof that being in a terrible film like this does not necessarily destroy your career. You can, over time and with better scripts, overcome the embarrassment of being in \"The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre\".</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">This, the fourth in the original series of CHAINSAW films, is without a doubt the oddest yet. Gone is the grinding horror of the original movie, in favour of an out-and-out comedy. It's easy to see why no more sequels were released after this, at least until Michael Bay's franchise 'reboot' – the formula had been worked into the ground and only repetition could follow. THE NEXT GENERATION is widely regarded as the worst of the series, a total non-event with more horror to be found in a pair of smelly socks, but I think critics are missing the point. This isn't MEANT to be a horror flick – instead it's a comedy.<br/><br/>The threadbare plot is nothing new, a simple sequence of events designed to get some innocent teenagers into the chainsaw household. Once here, the sole surviving female finds herself menaced by a group of mad men (and a woman!). Director Kim Henkel, who wrote and produced the original classic, has plenty of affinity with his material and his focus here is to create new extremes out of old. The film is a chronicle of screeching insanity with every actor encouraged to go way over the top in the call of duty, and I have to admit, I enjoyed the film simply because it's so odd.<br/><br/>Of course, it's saddled with cheesy '90s production values and a dearth of characterisation. The teenage 'good guys' are utterly devoid of interest, and the only interesting thing about the main character of Jenny is that the actress portraying her is Renee Zellweger, years before she became really famous in Hollywood. There's no sign of future greatness here, Zellweger is no different from a hundred other teenage scream queens. No, the real interest comes from the complete nutters portraying the 'family'. Leatherface is back, acted by a different actor and this time dressing up as an old woman; he's not menacing at all here, but instead slightly endearing and completely loopy, screaming just as much as Zellweger! The real star of the show, though, is another pre-stardom actor, Matthew McConaughey, playing demented murderer Vilmer. Interesting, McConaughey takes over from ANOTHER pre-stardom actor, Viggo Mortensen, who played virtually the same character in the previous sequel, Leatherface. McConaughey goes above and beyond with a performance of immense energy and physicality and watching him creeping around, complete with bionic leg (!) and harassing people is what makes the film.<br/><br/>So there you have THE NEXT GENERATION. It's an overpadded film, full of long, slightly dull chase scenes and an overacting McConaughey literally chewing up the scenery. It may not be art, but I did laugh a lot in comparison to many other so-called Hollywood 'comedies'.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The (1994) <br/><br/>1/2 (out of 4)<br/><br/>Director/writer Kim Henkel was the man behind the screenplay to that legendary 1974 hit and he returned to this film in hopes of it being a direct sequel. No matter what the original idea was, this film, when it was finally released after countless years, is a complete disaster from the start. Four kids (one played by Renee Zellweger) leave their prom and end up on a back road where they're attacked and tortured by the psychotic family led by Leatherface. This \"sequel\" is pretty much just a remake but with some strange sense of humor that never works. I'm really not sure what they were trying here because the film is a complete mess that never really makes any sense. The film has Leatherface pretty much playing a scream queen as he's constantly putting on make up be it lip stick or fingernail polish. Okay, for a comedy. That would make you think you're watching a comedy but the very next scene will be something extremely dark that puts you back into a horror film. The entire movie jumps back and forth and it's not because they're trying to mix the genres but I think it's because no one was really paying attention to trying to make a good film. The dialogue is without question horrid and just take a listen to the scene where one of the killers has murdered one man in front of another and the man that's still alive says \"you're scaring me\" as if he hadn't witnessed anything major yet. Even dumber is the kids getting lost even though they're driving in their town and are only a few minutes away from their school. I know there are two versions of this thing and I've seen them both and neither one adds any sense. The screenplay doesn't seem to know anything except that it likes to show scenes of the female characters being tortured. The women here are kicked, punched, slapped, poked, spit on, flicked, shocked and countless other things. I'm not one of those who are against violence towards women in horror films but this movie is just pathetic in how cheap it is all around. Matthew McConaughey is actually fairly good in his role as he's clearly hamming it up just so he can at least say he's entertaining. Zellweger is also pretty good considering the screenplay doesn't leave her too much to do. In the end, this is without question the worst film in the series and I'm still not sure what on earth the filmmakers were thinking. It's a complete mess from start to finish and it's a film that could have sat on the shelf for a couple decades without the need to be released.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">The first stories about the infamous cannibal family emerged in 1973. It's 1996 and it's been quiet for a few years. Jenny (Renée Zellweger) is at her high school prom. She gets brought along with her 'friends' when they get into a car crash. She heads off to find help. She and her friends fall prey to the secret cannibals and murderous tow truck driver Vilmer (Matthew McConaughey).<br/><br/>This is a few months after Dazed and Confused. Both Zellweger and McConaughey would go from that indie darling to this forgotten horror comedy and eventually onwards to becoming Academy Awards winning stars. It's amazing to see the two Texans doing an iconic Texas horror franchise. Strict franchise fanatics would hate this Leatherface. There's no way any cinema snobs would like this. At the time, these future stars were nobodies. I can understand its dismissal at the time of its release. I myself am watching it for the first time. It is pure joy to watch McConaughey go full crazy and Zellweger finding her inner scream queen. This is also a little fun. Darla is a little funny but the drive-thru takes it too far. This movie has probably improved markedly due to the performances of its famous stars.</div>\n",

Not even Renee Zellweger and Matthew McConaughey could save this one.<br/><br/>The problems I have with this film are that there is practically no plot, and what what little plot there may be is stolen outright from the original film. If I wanted to watch a film about people in a cannibal house getting chased by a man with a chainsaw, I would watch the original. This film has nothing on that.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">The original film is great, the second film was alright, the third film was adequate, and this was the final official sequel before the remakes came along, but unfortunately, it did not turn out as I expected or hoped it would. Basically, in the mid-1990s, teenagers Jennifer \"Jenny\" (Renée Zellweger), Heather (Lisa Marie Newmyer), Barry (Tyler Shea Cone), and Sean (John Harrison) are celebrating during their senior prom. They are driving through Texas when they are forced to take a detour off the freeway. Heather makes a wrong turn, driving them into a remote area. Distracted, after thinking she saw something, she crashes into another driver. They get out and help the shaken driver, Sean looks after him while the others look for help. Heather, Barry, and Jenny find a rural real estate office, there insurance agent Darla (Tonie Perensky) calls up her boyfriend Vilmer (Matthew McConaughey), a tow truck driver, to help them. Meanwhile, Heather and Barry are separated from Jennifer. Vilmer eventually arrives at the crash scene, where he breaks the driver's neck and chases Sean in his pickup, eventually running him over. Meanwhile, Heather and Barry come across a dilapidated farmhouse. Barry goes inside and asks Walter (Joe Stevens), Vilmer's brother to use the bathroom. While waiting on the porch, Heather is captured by Leatherface (introducing Robert Jacks), who stuffs her inside a meat locker. Meanwhile, Barry discovers human remains in the bathroom, then he is bludgeoned to death by Leatherface. Afterwards, the killer removes Heather from the meat locker and hangs her on a meat hook. Jennifer returns to the car and meets Vilmer, who shows her the bodies of Sean and the driver, and then chases her in his truck, but she escapes into the woods. Leatherface attempts to attack her, chasing her wielding a chainsaw, until she makes it back to Darla's office, begging for help. But Darla and Walter are accomplices, they subdue Jenny and take her to the Sawyer family home. Jennifer falls unconscious and awakens at a dinner table with the cannibalistic family. Joining them is a mysterious suited man named Mr. Rothman (James Gale), a member of a secret organisation responsible for many of the world's major events. He has hired the family to show \"the true meaning of horror\" but criticises them for botching their mission. After Mr. Rothman leaves, a furious Vilmer kills Heather, crushing her skull. Jennifer tries to escape but is held down by Vilmer as Leatherface prepares to kill her. However, she manages to hurt Vilmer and escapes. Fleeing to the main road, Jenny is helped by an elderly couple in an RV, but the vehicle is turned over by Vilmer and Leatherface, forcing Jennifer to run. Eventually, an airplane appears overhead and hits Vilmer's skull with its blade, killing him. Jenny is picked up by a passing black limousine, but she is shocked to find Rothman inside. He tells Jenny that her experience was supposed to be spiritual, but it went wrong and that Vilmer had to be stopped. She is dropped off at a hospital, where police question her. Also starring Chris Kilgore as Rothman's Chauffeur, Vince Brock as I'm Not Hurt, Susan Loughran as Jenny's Mother, David Laurence as Jenny's Stepfather, and Grayson Victor Schirmacher as Grandfather. As the films have continued, the violence and blood spill have increased and gone more over-the-top, but this 90s offering hardly has any deaths or gory stuff at all, and that makes it a real disappointment. There is nothing wrong with up-and-coming and established stars Zellweger and McConaughey, but there should have been much more of iconic masked murderer Leatherface, the pace was uneven, the story is dull, and to be honest, I felt bored almost the entire way through with hardly anything worthwhile happening, a most disappointing and hardly mentionable horror. Adequate!</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">The fourth film in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre series, The Next Generation, receives a lot of flack from many fans of all things Leatherface, but although I can appreciate why (it rarely takes matters seriously and doesn't make much sense), I still manage to get a kick out of the movie. Writer/director Kim Henkel's totally bonkers style, the chaotic storyline, and gleeful over-acting from almost everyone involved ensures that, although it might not be 'classic' Chainsaw, part four can still be plenty of fun!<br/><br/>A pre-fame Renée Zellweger plays nerdy teenager Jenny (apparantly, wearing a pair of glasses magically transforms her instantly from hot Hollywood starlet to frumpy geek), one of a group of teenagers who become stranded in the Texas woods after a car crash and fall prey to a clan of cannibals (led by Vilmer, a psycho with a remote-controlled leg, played enthusiastically by rising star Matthew McConaughey).<br/><br/>Watching The Next Generation expecting anything remotely resembling logic or narrative cohesion is a completely pointless exercise, 'cos there isn't any; the best approach to take with Henkel's crazy concoction is to just go with the flowrevel in its sheer lunacy, bask in its stupidity, but never question what is happening or why. That way, transvestite Leatherface won't come as such a shock, the Illuminati-style millionaire with belly piercings won't keep you awake at night questioning his relevance, and sudden attacks from airplanes will seem perfectly reasonable.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Written and directed by Kim Henkel, who wrote the original film, this take on the Sawyer family has sadly been forgotten, but it had - as so many films do - a rocky creation, a two year period where it disappeared and features two big stars who pretty much don't want anything to do with it. It's also the last movie in the original timeline of the films before remake and reboot and reimagining became the constant status quo for chainsaw movies.<br/><br/>I can see why some people dislike this movie. After all, there's now a thousand-year-old secret society paying off the Sawyers - who now choose pizza over human flesh - to kill people to keep the population in a constant state of fear. Or maybe they do it so people can achieve transcendence through that terror. Leatherface, who used to be a killing machine, now struggles with not only his ability to capture and murder the teengers, but his sexuality, cross-dressing and screaming like a child.<br/><br/>He also does not use a chainsaw.<br/><br/>The real center of this story is Renée Zellweger's Jenny, who Henkel wrote the story around, claiming that was about \"her transformation, her refusal to shut up, to be silenced, to be victimized. And by extension her refusal to be oppressed.\" In the director's cut, it's shown that she's been abused her whole life, so the terror of the Sawyers leaves her unafraid.<br/><br/>Actually, they're now the Slaughters, not the Sawyers, and led by the other big star in this production - he wasn't at the time - Matthew McConaughey as Vilmer Slaughter, a maniac who combines the characteristics of the HItchhiker, Chop Top and Leatherface with a cybernetic leg and the need to self-scar himself. His wife Darla reveals much of the conspiracy theory in the film, except that she also claims that she has a bomb implanted in her skull and that Vilmer is from space.<br/><br/>This movie played 27 theaters, then Japan and then disappeared for two years, as CAA wanted nothing to ruin the success of McConaughey. It finally played in twenty cities in 1997. Yet it has its fans, as no less a Chainsaw fan as Joe Bob Briggs said, \"This is the best horror film of the 90s\" and called this \"a flick so terrifying and brilliant that it makes the other two Chainsaw sequels seem like \"After-School Specials.\"<br/><br/>The end of the film features John Dugan, Grandfather from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Paul A. Partain, who was Franklin and Marilyn Burns, who was Sally. I love that she locks eyes with Kenny as the movie closes. I also adore that this movie has so many Texas bands, like \"Der Einziger Weg\" by Debbie Harry and Robert Jacks (who was Leather in this), plus songs by Roky Erickson and Daniel Johnston.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Could this film possibly be as bad as they say it is? Actually no, .it's even WORSE! From start to finish, this thing is a complete load of nonsense and extremely irritating crap! Not ONE line that is spoken by anyone of the performers makes even a tad bit of sense. In fact, your ears start to hurt after a while from listening to all that useless and dumb chatting. You cannot believe what they dare to bring to the screen here. The dialogs and one-liners without a doubt belong to the crappiest that were ever written. Give a typewriter to a 5-year-old child and he'll do a better job than Kim Henkel did. And they don't have to start claiming it's meant to be like this and that it's supposed to be a comical spoof.because it's too idiotic to be a comedy and too painfully amateurish to be a spoof. There's another name for it.rubbish!<br/><br/>In every possible way, this pile of garbage is a disgrace to the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre and blasphemy to the genre of horror. There's no structure to be found whatsoever! Characters are disappearing all of a sudden and they don't get mentioned anymore thorough the whole movie, while other, newly introduced types are supposed to fit in right away. The members of the maniacal family are stupid, empty and utterly annoying. Especially the image of Leatherface is messed up badly. All of a sudden, he suffers from a serious identity crisis got really lame. Even when he's appearing in his most 'scary' form, he's only a glimpse of the portrayal Gunnar Hansen once gave. I guess the local and ambitious wannabe stars Zellweger and McConaughey would have done anything at that point of their careers to be noticed.I'm surprised they grew out to be famous after this anyhow! They should be pointed at and laughed for being part of this piece of junk. Writer-director Kim Henkel had her 15 minutes of fame when she co-wrote the original, along with Tobe Hooper. She now turned into a complete joke herself. TCM: The Next Generation isn't even bad enough to be good.it's bad, period.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Sick-in-the-head sequel to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise featuring another group of teenagers(after their senior prom) unequipped psychologically against the twisted sickos who live nearby. Only poor pretty Renée Zellweger seems able to survive the twisted onslaught lead by Matthew McConaughey(tearing rabidly into every scene like a rabies infested mutt)and others as she's either running for her life or going mad, with whimpers and nervous twitches as a result. Leatherface(under disguise is Robert Jacks this time around)is mostly dressed under female skin, wigs, and dresses(!) swinging his chainsaw like a madman never knowing what it might take out whether it be a limb or door. Tonie Perensky as Matthew McConaughey's squeeze Darla is as nutty as the rest of the clan, although she looks relatively normal on the surface. Sadly she's really Zellweger's only ally. You have Joe Stevens as WE, who is always quoting something someone else has put to paper, whether it be Shakespeare or Emerson, even though the saying might have nothing at all to do with the event in front of him. Poor hottie Lisa Marie Newmyer as prom queen Heather gets thrown in a freezer containing dead skin, hung on a meat hook, doused and set on fire, &amp; her skull crushed. What's even more sick is whose ACTUALLY behind all these psychopaths..some man of wealth who believes that what horrors he offers the unfortunate victims is means for a more spiritual experience! <br/><br/>McConaughey drives his tow truck over one poor soul numerous times for fun, Leatherface slams a sledgehammer over one's head(at least it stopped there for him), and Renée Zellweger actually scales the sick clan's house with Leatherface slicing bricks from their chimney with his chainsaw at her! There's a moment in the film where Joe enjoys sticking Zellweger with a cattle-prod. And, to cap off the madness, not only does McConaughey like to cut himself with a knife when angered, he also has this robotic leg that goes haywire if somebody has this specific remote control.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre starts late one night on 'May 22 1996' when Heather (Lisa Marie Newmyer) spots her boyfriend Barry (Tyler Cone) kissing another girl, upset she gets into her car &amp; begins to drive away but Barry manages to get in before she does. In the back seat are two of their friends Jenny (Renee Zellweger) &amp; Sean (John Harrison), as they argue about various things they suddenly realise they are lost in some woods. Then out of nowhere a car hits them &amp; they are forced off the road, Jenny, Heather &amp; Barry head off to find help while Sean stays behind to look after the injured driver of the other car &amp; before long a guy named Vilmer (Matthew McConaughey) turns up in a wrecker. Unfortunately for Sean Vilmer is a psycho &amp; kills him. Meanwhile Jenny, Heather &amp; Barry find an isolated house where they are terrorised by the inhabitants including the chainsaw wielding retard Leatherface (Robert Jacks). Who will survive &amp; what will be left of them...?<br/><br/>Written, produced &amp; directed by Kim Henkel &amp; probably more commonly known under the title The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation (maybe whoever retitled it was a Star Trek fan) this was the fourth Texas Chainsaw Massacre film &amp; is easily the worst. The script at times copies exact scenes from the original in particular the scene when a girl is dragged screaming through a corridor &amp; a bit when she is lifted up &amp; impaled on a meat hook, the escape from the house felt very familiar &amp; the final shot where Leatherface is swinging his chainsaw around in anger as the sole surviving teenage girl drives off into safety. Unfortunately The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre is an awful film in every way possible, the character's are clichéd &amp; annoying, it's predictable, it's totally bloodless &amp; devoid of any exploitation, it is punctuated with lame attempts at humour &amp; there are some truly bizarre plot developments. How, for instance, can someone be driving through a dense city &amp; then within what seems like 5 minutes suddenly become lost in some woods even though there seems to be plenty of roads around? How can these bunch of killers operate so openly? Who on Earth is that guy in the suit at the end who unbuttons his shirt to reveal his body is pierced with large rings?! Who was in the plane? Are we to assume the average crop spraying pilot would use the propeller on his plane to kill people? There are so many things wrong with this film, there are so many bad parts, stupid parts, annoying parts &amp; it's a film without any balls whatsoever so no one even comes close to being killed with a chainsaw. This isn't a massacre for god's sake, I saw more blood when I cut myself shaving this morning.<br/><br/>Director Henkel turns in a really crappy film, there are various continuity mistakes that you don't even have to look that closely to see &amp; as a whole it has no style or visual quality. The comedy elements are out-of-place with scenes of Vilmers leg being operated by remote control! There is also the frankly embarrassing sight of seeing Leatherface dressed in drag, a wig &amp; putting lipstick on! A truly hideous image &amp; one that one just can't help but laugh at. There are no shocks, no horror, no gore whatsoever, we barely see a chainsaw &amp; generally speaking I think The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre fails miserably at what it sets out to do.<br/><br/>With a budget of $600,000 The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre is pretty sloppy &amp; poorly made throughout. The house interior is OK &amp; adds a little atmosphere but not enough. What on Earth are McConaughey &amp; Zellweger doing in this? I would imagine that the only reason The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre is of any interest is because these two make early acting appearances, I trust they have since fired their agents &amp; got better ones. To be fair to them I thought they both did OK considering the 3rd rate material they had to work with.<br/><br/>The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre is total crap, I can't really see why anybody would like it. The two previous sequels The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986) &amp; Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III (1990) are far superior so watch one of those again instead. According to the IMDb's 'Alternate Versions' section there was originally a longer cut that ran for 95 minutes rather than the one widely available which runs for about 86, I shudder at the very thought...</div>\n",

This one though is just bad...as it mainly involves Renee being terrorized by Matthew.  That is basically all you see.  It sort of mirrors the first one, but then it doesn't.  In that one Leatherface was an important character...here he is a cross dresser.  Matthew who is playing the hitchhiker role from the first one is the main attraction and it just doesn't equal all that much terror this time around.  I don't think a single person was killed with a chainsaw, unless it happened within the first 10 or so minutes that I missed before tuning in.  My advice is skip this one and don't even watch it until you have seen the first one.  If you want to see it after that it is up to you cause there are some positive reviews to be found for this one.  For me, though, this one was awful.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">This movie is bad, sometimes laughably bad. It's basically a rehash of the 3rd one, except way way more cheesy and corny. Even for a horror movie, characters making decisions that doesn't make any sense goes into another level. There is just random stupidity riddled around this movie. It has Renée Zellweger and Matthew McConaughey, but that doesn't even help this movie at all. Matthew McConaughey is usually good at playing psychotic southern maniac so he fit right into his role with this one. Seriously, how many psychotic relatives does the creepy grandpa have anyways? Maybe I am missing something, but didn't that creepy old guy die in the third one? They even made Leatherface a pizza eating transvestite...Seriously. I am not sure, if they intentionally made this movie bad, but it's downright bad. I give this movie a 2.3 because although it's in the awful category I was able to sit through it without having that huge urge to just leave. But that really isn't saying much. The acting in a lot of parts is just laughably bad, like they were intentionally not trying. It doesn't even have the entertainment value to sit with a group of friends and just roast it. In another words, it doesn't add anything to the table. This is a simple and yet confusing movie that just doesn't make any sense. And it's filled with awful ideas, seriously it has Leatherface the pizza eating transvestite? This is the sequel that killed off this franchise, until the reboot. It's better to just skip this one, it has absolutely no relation to the previous movies of this franchise.<br/><br/>2.3/10</div>\n",

Why even bother watching/reviewing Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation (or Part IV) other than my obsession in completing a franchise /series reviews for my site?* Part 2 was vile. Part 3 was worse. Part 4 fell even further. But I honestly don't see any real point in diving in on how bad and badly made this diseased series has become. A quick summary was it appeared to be completely improved, no script, no consistency and no reason for Leatherface (now with yet another new family – reason ??) to be a drag queen.<br/><br/>Prom Night occurs and incredibly dumb kids get lost, blah blah, they're lead back to yet another creepy house and seated around another disgusting table, blah blah, they're terrorized. Only this time – spoiler! Actually in this case I don't mind spoiling, as it might save you more time to spend with loved ones than watching this crud – they introduce some dominatrix male in a suit who controls everything for whatever dumb reason. I believe this was to lead into a part 5 that (THANK GOD) never happened, much like the open ended plot holes that happened in both at the end of Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers and Aliens Vs. Predators.<br/><br/>As much as I was angry at life after Texas Chainsaw 2 and 3, I think I just gave up during this viewing. Sure, as bad as the predecessor sequels were, this takes the absolute cake in horrible film making. It has wretched acting, intolerable dialogue and a pointless script.<br/><br/>Despite the fact I wouldn't normally agree with actors attempting to halt film releases when they have already completed a film, I have to side, just for the extreme embarrassment defense, with both McConaughey and Zellweger's feeble attempts to stop Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation from being freed to the world. Unfortunately they lost. What kind of world do we live in when OJ (originally) walks and this movie is distributed. There is no justice after all.<br/><br/>Does it go without saying: SKIP IT? * - Side Note: I did go out of order. I first rewatched TCM Remake, then the remake's prequel, followed by TCM 2, 3 and 4. I still have to go back to the absolute beginning to complete the series of reviews. I do pray they don't make any more.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">After prom, four friends end up lost in the middle of nowhere Texas. They crash their car and are forced to set off on foot to look for help. Unfortunately for our heroes, they're stranded in the wrong place. They'll spend the night fighting for their lives against a crazed family of killers.<br/><br/>Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation (TCM:TNG) is another of those movies that I really, really want to like (I've got something of a man-crush on Matthew McConaughey). Until last night, I hadn't seen the movie in at least 10 years. I sat down hoping I was wrong and it would work this time. If anything, TCM:TNG is worse than I remembered. <br/><br/>There are scores of problems I could write about, but the main one is the film's plot - or more precisely, the lack of a plot. There's really not much here that resembles a coherent story. It's a mish-mash of recycled ideas, attempts at humor, story elements involving a secret governmental-whatever that come out of nowhere, and generally poor filmmaking. Add it all up and it's one big disaster. It's amazing to sit and watch a film with the words Texas Chainsaw Massacre in the title and not find one scary or suspenseful moment. Take McConaughey's introduction as Vilmer as an example. The movie sees fit to leave the viewer in suspense about Vilmer's intentions for no more than 10 seconds before he's revealed to be a bad guy. Why not let the character be something of a mystery for a while so that when he makes his murderous tendencies known, it's a surprise? But no, that might have made for an interesting plot twist and you can't have anything like that in TCM:TNG. <br/><br/>A well deserved 3/10 from me.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">A group of stupid teenagers coming from a prom get into a car crash in the woods of Texas, prompting some Texas hillbillies &amp; the infamous Leatherface to torture them. Why, why, why, why, why? Was the constant question that kept popping up in my brain while watching this turkey. I saw the cut version and I highly doubt I missed anything noteworthy. Added gore wouldn't change my opinion on this dreck. There is no suspense what so ever (Aside from an admittedly decent rooftop sequence), it is rather dull, and it really doesn't take itself all that seriously. Where to begin on all the flaws. I'll start with Leatherface. Gone, is the terror that Leatherface provides, replaced by a shrill scream that can give even the calmest people of headaches. It got to the point where I almost muted my T.V. He also wears lipsticks, dressing up like a transvestite. For someone who wanted to make a true sequel to the original, Kim Henkel pis**** all over it instead. I didn't give a damn about any of the characters in this one, I wanted them all to perish. Also, how is it that the villains are so attractive? I had a hard time believing that someone with Matthew McConaughery's looks could be that sadistic, as well as Renee Zellweger being \"ugly\" , as she is inexplicably called in this film. Zellweiger does what she can with the awful material, but her character is stupidly written to the point where I wanted to smack her one. This was released in 1997 to try to take advantage of Zellweger &amp; McConaughery's surging popularity. Speaking of McConaughery... he is probably the best thing in this film. He gives a completely over the top and unhinged performance. He was a blast to watch on many occasions. He knew what a piece of crap this was, as evident when he tried to prohibit this from being distributed in theaters, so he had some fun with the role. Robert Jacks is a disgrace to Leatherface. It isn't entirely his fault though. The rest of the cast isn't worth mentioning, aside from the Marilyn Burns cameo at the end. Blink and you'll miss it.<br/><br/>Final Thoughts: Even the most die-hard fans of TCM will despise this film. If you're a masochist, then by all means view this movie. If you have enough beers, this MIGHT be good for a few laughs, but it would take quite a few beer <br/><br/>DUD</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">This the forth Texas chainsaw massacre movie. It not has scarier as the original The Texas chainsaw massacre from 1974. Also The Texas chainsaw massacre 2 is scarier. Also Leather face Texas chainsaw massacre III is scarier. But there no reason to say this is a awful movie. There is reason why people do not like this. It is the forth one. I think that would be the reason. This a very scary movie. I keep hearing that the fifth part to the original series Chainsaw massacre 3.D is better. This a great movie. And Chainsaw massacre 3.D is just awful. I The Texas chainsaw massacre remake from 2003 is not better then is movie. It is just boring crape. I can't believe people think Texas chainsaw massacre the beginning is better. That movie is producible and boring. In this movie you don't know what is going to happen still you see it. The fist three The Texas chainsaw massacre movies are better but only by a little bite. This movie has a great story line. It also has great acting. It also has great special effects. I consider this horror fantasy because the killer in this movie are ghouls. This movie is a must see.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">...And you will know that meaning if the prospect of having to sit and endure this film comes your way. Run. Hide. Disappear. I am really at a loss for words in many ways to describe just how bad, ridiculous, appalling, and horrible this film is. A group of teenagers are out on prom night when they are redirected on the road down another route only to find a car with a kid hit them, a beautiful Realtor in a cheap office late at night with a neighbor across the street who is never explained, a variety of people going through this place where we are led to believe these terrible atrocities that are about to ensue could happen, and, of course, the house with the crazed killers. Who would these killers be: (1)Matthew McConauhey as Vilmer - a crazed psychotic with a powered mechanical leg who takes a knife to his body(shirtless of course)repeatedly, yells maniacally throughout, beats his girlfriend, steps on another girl's face, bites said girls nose almost off, etc... (2)W. E. - Joe Stevens plays the cattle-prodding brother who quotes(and misquotes) the likes of Thoraeu, Macciavelli, and others whilst having virtually nothing else to do except mercilessly poke and prod girls with a cattle prod(who knew prod could be such a versatile word?) (3)Darla - Tonie Perensky as Vilmer's supposedly almost stable girlfriend who is the Realtor and seems to enjoy the high of being with a man with a powered leg, a girlfriend beater, and living in a squalid house where there is no way in hell that she could dress as nice as she does for her job. Perensy is about the only thing I really did enjoy in the film. Not for her performance but for her bust of which we are given a brief but gratifying look at. Other than that she wildly acts hysterically throughout. (4)Grandfather - a truly thankless role as he is in one scene and has nothing to do. ... and, finally, (5) Leatherface - played by Robert Jacks and giving an absurd portrayal of this clownish killer figure. Watch the ending as he wields that chainsaw after the ludicrous Winebago scene. I almost fell out of my recliner laughing at the cinematic ineptitude of that sequence, the lack of directorial competence, and Jacks playing it way - WAY - over the top. Yes, Renee Zellweger plays the main tortured soul who has to watch these crazed thespians(way to generous here with that appellation)run amuck in a disgusting house. She isn't very good either but does manage to evoke mediocrity here and there - almost some credibility in the beginning of the film. You are never really sure where this film is going. Is it trying to be camp, horror, grotesque comedy, or a combination? I never really knew which it was trying to aspire to but do know that it achieved none. This film is just a really bad film with some supposedly good talent. The acting as aforementioned is universally bad. The writing is just ridiculous: what is with the Realtor angle? Who is Rothman? What happens at the end? Who was that guy in the bathroom at the top room upstairs that gives a gun to a girl? How did Vilmer get his legs like that? So many questions and virtually no answers. Yes, I know films like this don't have to have lots of answers but they need something to bridge the gap between imagination and credibility. The bridge here was blown right out of the water. Most of all, the biggest reason this film fails is due to the uninsightful, gratuitous, poorly crafted direction of one-time director Kim Henkel. I really didn't see anything in this film that cried out for his talent. Sure, I have seen a lot worse than this and there are many, many films which are crafted even more poorly. But when one connects the material with the cast and everything else - potential must be factored in to the equation as well. This one doesn't come even remotely close to the sum of what its parts could have been. A total bust(remember that was the only highlight- highlights).</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">The Next Generation for the Texas Chainsas Massacre movies is the equal of The Curse of Michael Myers to the Halloween movies.<br/><br/>I had a hard time in order to find this movie. I stepped into a little, obscure Video Center and in order to watch \"TCM The Next Generation\" I had to become a member. The attendant didn't want to sell it. <br/><br/>Anyways, the box cover is really weird. A tranvestie Leatherface stands holding a chainsaw between the faces of McConaughey and Zellweger. (I scanned the image in case someone wants it). I must say that I'm very disappointed of this sequel especially because Kim Henkel wrote and directed it. I had mixed feelings after watching the movie. At first I thought it's a decent mid 90's slasher flick with a confusing story. Then I thought about it as a 90's version of the events of the original TCM. Then I thought about it as a mediocre attempt to remake the original and adding 90's horror movies elements. Then I was like \"what a f***ed up movie!\". Then I put my ideas together and I reached the conclusion that this is a bizarre horror movie. Not bizarre like TCM 2 which was fun and gory. It's bizarre in a bad way because it makes no sense, the dialogue is awful, the characters are cartoonish, the events are stupid, the script goes nowhere, there aren't explanations to important events, etc. <br/><br/>The first half an hour is quite good for an early 90's slasher flick. There's a little suspense and some weird moments. The first half of the movie is a re-make of the events of the original. We get the hammer in the head, the girl hanging from the hook, Leatherface's crisis, Leatherface chasing Jenny, the hitch hiker routine, Jenny asking for help to just be driven to the house, etc. I must say that these scenes are actually well done. Specially the rooftop sequence. It looks really creepy when Leatherface comes out from the window and chases Jenny in the rooftop. It's always nice to watch these scenes mainly because they're great moments in the original TCM. <br/><br/>After these scenes; the movie goes abruptly downhill. The second half of the movie is a disaster. What the hell does the FBI has to do with the Sawyers?! What's with the \"mission to make people feel horror\" line?! The clan are cannibals! Why would someone mess with the original story and add FBI and aliens? The \"torture\" that Jenny goes through is not even 5% what Marylin Burns went through. <br/><br/>THINGS TO SAVE ABOUT THE MOVIE. -The hammer in the head kill. -The hanging in the hook scene. Always works. -Leatherface's first appearance. -The rooftop chasing sequence. -Reneès performance. She's very hot! -McConaughey's psycho performance is pretty good. -The pre Scream scenes. -The cameos of Marylin Burns and Paul A. Partian. -Darla's breasts and her sexiness.<br/><br/>THE NEXT GENERATION is a mess. Fans like me are insulted and feel betrayed by Henkel. Watching a tranvestie Leatherface imitating the chainsaw \"dance\" is pathetic and hurts deep feelings. There's no gore or violence like in the previous TCM movies. The direction is in the caliber of a direct to video slasher, please. The soundtrack is lame! Horrible punk pop tracks. The dialogue is a disaster! Who cares if Barry lied to his exes about breast cancer? What's with the \"I'm a bitch but i play dumb\" line? Also, who cares about W.E.'s stupid quotes? This is the TCM sequel to hate, to boot, to bury. There's no need to look out for this movie. I did it because I'm a die hard fan of the series. <br/><br/>2/10. Fans will never forget this mess. What they've done to Leatherface is unspeakable.</div>\n",

But then there was that audition scene. If you've seen the movie, you know what I'm talking about. And from that moment forward, I was a mess. I'm obsessed with Emilia Jones's version of \"Both Sides Now\" on Spotify, and I'm already dreading the day I have to send my son off to college (he's 12, by the way).<br/><br/>This movie is warm and earnest in the best possible way. Jones gives a marvelous performance -- it's too bad she couldn't have received more recognition for this. And Marlee Matlin and Troy Kotsur give equally wonderful performances as Jones's parents. A scene where Matlin tells Jones that she was disappointed when she wasn't born deaf, and another where Kotsur has his daughter sing to him while he feels her throat are two of the most devastating you'll see in movies this year.<br/><br/>Grade: A+</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Greetings again from the darkness. Ruby Rossi is a high school student. She is also a CODA - Child of Deaf Adults. Her older brother is deaf too, meaning Ruby's life has been spent as an interpreter for her family, while also working on the family fishing boat in Gloucester, Massachusetts, where they are treated as outcasts and viewed as oddities by others. Ruby also loves to sing and listen to music, activities she can't share with her family. This is no coming-of-age tale, as Ruby has long been wise beyond her years. It is, however, a story of a young person finding their true self and breaking from the ties that bind to the only life she's known.<br/><br/>Emilia Jones (HIGH-RISE, 2015) stars as Ruby, and we first see her slinging fish on the boat with her father Frank (Troy Kutsor) and brother Leo (newcomer Daniel Durant). Ruby belts out songs while the two men handle their duties, unaware of the lovely melodies filling the air. At home, the dinner table conversation is handled through ASL (American Sign Language) with mom/wife Jackie (Oscar winner Marlee Matlin, CHILDREN OF A LESSER GOD, 1986) leading the way.<br/><br/>At school, Ruby is an outcast due to her clothes, the lingering aroma of fish, and her \"weird\" family. With a silent crush on Miles (Ferdio Walsh-Peelo from the excellent SING STREET, 2016), Ruby signs up for choir, but freezes during the audition. The choir director, Bernardo (roll the r's) Villalobos, is played energetically and colorfully by Eugenio Derbez (OVERBOARD, 2018), and he offers encouragement to Ruby - mostly because she has a beautiful singing voice. Bernardo explains how her singing voice offers a path to college, something she's never before considered due to family responsibilities.<br/><br/>There is a lot going on in this film from writer-director Sian Heder (TALLULAH, 2016). It's obviously adapted from the 2014 French film LA FAMILLE BELIER, and plays as a mainstream crowd-pleaser, when it just as easily could have been a deep cut indie film. Ms. Heder's approach means a larger viewing audience, though there are elements we wish had been further explored. The teen romance never really clicks, and there are hints that Bernardo's story holds more levels than we get. However, the Rossi family dynamics are quite something to behold. Father Frank wears his emotions on his sleeve. Sometimes those emotions are angry and bitter, while other times quite comical or even horny (for his wife). Brother Leo wants desperately to lead the family business towards prosperity. He has ideas for growth, but is frustrated being dependent on Ruby as a conduit to the community.<br/><br/>Mother Jackie and Ruby have a typical mother-teenage daughter relationship. The mother wants status quo where the daughter remains an integral part of the family, while the daughter wants her mom to acknowledge the dreams for a different life - one that capitalizes on her talents. When Jackie questions her daughter on her singing, she does so in the most hurtful way possible (brilliant writing). And yet, when mom recounts Ruby's birth, the love is as clear as the disconnect ... and likely to draw a tear or two. Filmmaker Hader serves up numerous strong scenes, but two really stood out for this viewer. First, when Ruby is singing on stage, we \"hear\" what the parents hear, and their pride is obvious. The second occurs when dad asks Ruby to sing for him as they are perched on the backend of the car. It's phenomenal acting by Kutsor, and further clarifies a lifelong father-daughter bond ... and the first time he fully comprehends her talent. All four leads give strong performances, and it's a star-making performance from Ms. Jones (think a young Saoirse Ronan).<br/><br/>Apple paid a record-breaking $25 million for the film's rights at Sundance, and the mainstream appeal of this family drama sprinkled with comedy and life messages is indisputable. So while my preference would have been more focus on the 'outsider' aspect of the Rossi family in the community, it's easy to see why this choice was made. It's an entertaining film that will likely land on many year-end \"Best\" lists. Maybe even mine.<br/><br/>Streaming on AppleTV+ on August 13, 2021.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">The story of Coda is a bit cliché. Just by reading the ingredients you can already see where this movie is going. So no real surprises in Coda, you will exactly know the outcome way long before the ending. That said it's still an enjoyable movie to watch. A little bit emotional sometimes, which is almost normal as you feel compassion for the deaf people and certainly for the daughter that has a lot on her plate. Maybe a bit too much singing in my opinion but that's just because I'm not a big fan of singing in movies unless it's the music that I like but that's not likely to happen given my taste of music. Coda is predictable but it doesn't really matter as the acting is really good and that from the whole cast. Certainly worth a watch.</div>\n",

You can see where CODA is going, but it's so effective at what it does. There's a few laugh out loud moments (which I didn't expect) and the 3rd act is just as moving as films like Almost Famous and Sing Street, both movies with similar music/dream themes. There's something about those types of stories that appeal to me more than most people.<br/><br/>9.3/10.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">A coming-of-age comedy drama that's crafted with sincerity &amp; brims with authenticity, CODA covers the journey of the only hearing person in a culturally deaf family who finds herself torn between following her dreams &amp; fear of abandoning her parents in pursuit of her passion. It is a simple, heartfelt &amp; crowd-pleasing delight that's further bolstered by its welcome inclusivity &amp; emotional purity.<br/><br/>Written &amp; directed by Sian Heder, the premise is nothing new and the route it takes is also a familiar one but the emotional beats do strike the right chord with the heart and makes it an endearing, arresting &amp; heartwarming roller-coaster. Its portrait of deaf community in typical, day-to-day settings is carried out with care &amp; understanding and the family dynamic is both relatable &amp; thoroughly captivating.<br/><br/>The small-town setting, radiant camerawork, intelligent wit, breezy pace &amp; silent interplays add more exuberance to the experience but it's the performances from its entire cast &amp; the spot-on chemistry they share with one another that strengthens the picture from inside out. Emilia Jones is impressive as our protagonist struggling to juggle her family's interests with her own and she is brilliantly supported by the rest.<br/><br/>Overall, CODA (Child of Deaf Adults) takes an existing coming-of-age template, doesn't try to subvert any of the genre tropes, and even features an ending that's predictable from afar. Yet it is brought to cinematic life with so much heart, warmth &amp; affection that the film's honesty &amp; humanity not only stands out but shines through. Add to that, it serves as a powerful reminder of why representation matters and the difference it can make when done correctly.</div>\n",

Congratulations to Emilia Jones, she learned the deaf language and took a singing course for this role. She really did a tremendous job. Marlee Matlin and Troy Kostur also performed very well. No matter how good the movie is, it looks like an Oscar-formula movie :) Also, I was surprised when I heard that this movie was a remake. I will watch the original french movie soon. Anyway, I liked the movie. I don't think it would win the best picture award, but if it will . I'll be just happy.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">\"CODA\" is a Drama movie in which we watch a young woman living and helping her deaf family. She wants to study music in the university but she also wants to continue helping their family's fishing business. She is between these two ways and she has only one choice to make.<br/><br/>Many people compare this movie with \"La famille Bélier\" of 2014 but there are some difference between them and they are not the same. I found \"CODA\" (CODA means Child Of Deaf Adults) beautiful and I enjoyed it very much because it had a nice, interesting plot addressing many important and unsolved subjects that society has to deal with as soon as possible. The direction which was made by Sian Heder presented very well these subjects in a very clever way combinig comedy with drama, and also made them understood very clear from the audience. The interpretation of Emilia Jones who played as Ruby Rossi was simply outstanding. Other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Troy Kotsur's who played as Frank Rossi, Daniel Durant's who played as Leo Rossi and Amy Forsyth's who played as Gertie. Finally, I have to say that \"CODA\" is an amazing movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it because you will enjoy it but you will learn something from it, too.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">\"CODA\" stands for \"child of deaf adults\". Ruby Rossi (Emilia Jones), at 17 when we first meet her (and still so at the end of the movie) is born into such a family, with parents and an older brother all deaf. As the only \"hearing\" member of the family, she has been their bridge of communication with the rest of the world. But, is that role really Ruby's destiny? Families made up entirely of deaf members still survive. That is the question asked throughout the movie. Helping to run the family's fishing boat, Ruby has a talent for singing and is well poised to pursue an education and a career in music.<br/><br/>CODA does not really have anything that you have not seen before. It opens in a light tone, and continues that way. Some examples. When poor Ruby, exhausted, naps in the middle of a class on constitutional history, the teacher approaches her desk and mutters \"unfortunately, there is no amendment protecting the right to nap\". Explaining why he has the car radio turned in full blast, her deaf brother Leo (Daniel Durant) quips \"my whole ass is vibrating\". Finally, treating the parent for some minor ailment, the doctor explains that they should abstain from sex for 2 weeks. In her sign language interpretation (for which the audience has subtitle), when the anxious parents ask how long, Ruby sings \"forever\". After a moment of satisfaction in seeing the horror on their faces, Ruby corrects \"two weeks\".<br/><br/>The story is, as mentioned, all but predictable. The slightly eccentric but entirely endearing music teacher Mr V (Eugenio Derbez), seeing Ruby's talents, secures an audition for her to win a place to a prestigious music school in Boston. Her value to her family is now the main obstacle. A sub-plot, quite predictably, is on how the hearing-impaired deal with their handicaps in a world where not everybody is sympathetic. There is also a sweet teenage romance.<br/><br/>\"Been there; done that\" is what my headline intimates. However, the beauty of CODA is the way the story is told, and acted. More examples.<br/><br/>In the scene where Mr. V tries to convince Ruby to seriously pursue singing, he asks \"how do you feel when you sing\". She replies in sign language! And he (and you) understands. A nice touch. Rehearsing a duet for the school concert, Ruby, facing her tender, charming classmate Miles (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo), finds that she cannot focus. They find a perfect solution: back-to-back, feeling each other vibration but avoiding distracting eye contact, they harmonize beautifully. At the concert, the entire family applaud and cheer for her, taking the cue from the rest of the audience. Watching this, you cannot help but feel a little sad. Then, the poignancy finally hit home when right in the middle of the beautiful singing, the sound is muted. Abruptly, you are thrown into the world of absolute silence of Frank (Troy Kotsur), Jackie (Marlee Matlin) and Daniel Rossi.<br/><br/>The most touching scene comes after the concert, with father and daughter together, alone, under the starlight. After \"hearing\" his daughter's performance, Frank's mind is made up, that pursuing Ruby's destiny in music should be the priority, for the entire family. But he wants to hear her sing, just to him. As she starts to sing for him the love duet, which can also be interpreted as a song of simple devotion, he puts his fingers to her throat, feeling the vibration. Watching Kotsur and Jones in this scene melts the most cynical of hearts. This scene, which is pure tenderness, is surpassed by only one more. The audition scene is both deeply touching and joyfully elating. I am not going to spoil it. While the father-and-daughter scene was only close to bringing tears to my eyes, the audition scene finally did it.<br/><br/>Against all odds, director Sian Heder succeeded in casting Ruby's family with hearing-handicapped (total deaf to sever hearing impaired) actors. Their performance says everything.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Put simply, Apple original film CODA (a remake of 2014 French film La Famille Belier) that stands for Child of Deaf Adults has no right being as charming and effective as it is, as it takes a generic and even predictable story too great heights to present what is surely one of 2021's great feel good films, one that is guaranteed to leave you with a great big smile on your face come the closing credits.<br/><br/>A breakout film of 2021's Sundance Film Festival and one that has impressively made its mark across film award ceremonies and best of lists across the globe, director Sian Heder's film is one that never threatens to offer its viewers something that they haven't seen before in one iteration or another but while it may lull you into its story initially, come the films hugely impressive final acts you begin to understand that Heder and her cast have created a special film full of warmth, heart and soul.<br/><br/>Following Emilia Jones teenager Ruby, whose mother, father and brother are all deaf, CODA's story arc wont be surprising to anyone that's ever seen a family dramedy or coming of age tale before but Heder's film earns its stripes through a string of impressive acting turns, a whip-smart script and some hugely emotional segments that are sure to make even the hardest of hearts feel a slight stuttering of movement.<br/><br/>Front and centre to this tale of Ruby's journey of self-discovery and her place in the wider world outside of being her families lived in interpreter or boat hand is a career making turn from the awards worthy Emilia Jones.<br/><br/>Recognizable from films such as High-Rise and Brimstone as well as TV shows such as Utopia and Locke and Key, Jones may not be new to the game of acting but her hard work here learning how to do sign language as well as sing pays off big time in Heder's film and when she's working onscreen alongside Troy Kotsur or Marlee Matlin as her embarrassing parents Frank and Jackie (a scene involving them chatting to what they believe too be her new boyfriend is all time awkward) or a scene-stealing Eugenio Derbez as music teacher Bernardo Villalobos, there's reason to believe that we are witnessing a serious new talent enter into the picture of Hollywood.<br/><br/>All in all CODA plays out the way in which you may expect but its little surprises, intricacies and wonderfully realised moments ensure that when you consider what are the stand out feel good movies from the last 12 months, it's highly likely that this very human and very warm film is going to be sitting pretty at the top of that list.<br/><br/>Final Say -<br/><br/>It doesn't break new ground but CODA's unique family, wonderfully realised delivery and lead work by a memorable Emilia Jones ensures it's top-tier feel good movie making that is likely to live a long and prosperous life into the future.<br/><br/>4 loud car radios out of 5.<br/><br/>For more reviews check out Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)</div>\n",

      "Brief Review -<br/><br/>The New 'Star Is Born' meets a metaphorical coming-of-age story. So many metaphors and feelings and they don't need words at all. Yes, even today's modern stories can be metaphorical. Here's the proof. Not a regular coming of age story but a film with right emotions and sensitive conflicts. The reason to call 'The New Star Is Born' is nothing logical. It just 'came out'. It took me back to those days when musicals had heart at the right place unlike today's mediocre works that are being loved undeservingly. As a CODA (Child of Deaf Adults) Ruby is the only hearing person in her deaf family. When the family's fishing business is threatened, Ruby finds herself torn between pursuing her love of music by wanting to go to Berklee College of Music and her fear of abandoning her parents. So many metaphors in such a short time, I wonder how they managed it. This film is full of metaphors, you just have to keep your eyes and brain open for that, and yes more than ears. The girl is screwed up, not even that, I felt like she's tossed up in the air and is unable to decide which side to fall on. The mother confesses that she wished that her daughter should be deaf like her so that they won't have differences. The father, he's such a freak, such a blast of a person but does understand the right thing. The brother, though damn regular, is quite a sensible man who wishes his sister to go away- only for her best. The entire family is so freaking hilarious, vulgarly funny, sometimes messy but as a whole- a lovable affair. That last scene when the girl tells her mom, let's not make this a thing and then she herself comes back to make a scene. You know what, that's how a family should be. I found so many metaphors throughout the film but i think it missed that in the climax. Though it was sensible and realistic, I think it could have been better. Overall, a nice break from regular musicals and family dramas and please find your different metaphors on your own.<br/><br/>RATING - 7/10*<br/><br/>By - #samthebestest.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">As \"CODA\" (2012 release; 111 min.) opens, we are introduced to Ruby, a CODA (Child of Deaf Adults), as she is working with her dad and her brother on a fisher's boat just outside of Gloucester, MA. Ruby is a HS senior and on a whim, she decides to sign up for the choir class simply because she loves singing. At the very first choir orientation session, the choir master asks everyone in the class to come forward and sing \"Happy Birthday To You\" so that he can classify the voice (alt/soprano, etc.) When it's Ruby's turn, she panics and runs out of the class room... At this point we are 10 min. Into the film,. But to tell you more of the plot should spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this is the US remake of a 2014 film from France called \"La Famille Belier\", which was a hit both critically and at the box office. I've not seen it, and so I judge \"CODA\" as a standalone. Strictly going by what I saw on the movie screen, I have nothing but great things to say about it. \"CODA\" is directed by Sian Heder, best known for having written seasons 1-3 of \"Orange Is the New Black\". Here she brings some sharp observations on what it's like being deaf in today's world, and obviously it ain't easy. The film also explores the economic struggles for a community like Gloucester, and in particular its (mostly mom-and-pop) fishing industry. Last but not least the film smartly balances on the one hand the strong family ties in the Rossi family, and on the other hand Ruby's desire to branch out into the world. Of course none of this would matter if the acting lacks, but instead the acting is tops, period. Marlee Latin and 2 other deaf actors play Ruby's parents and brother. And then there is the role of Rubi, played by up-and-coming British actress Emilia Jones. She is nothing short of brilliant, and surely we haven't seen the last of her, on the contrary.<br/><br/>\"CODA\" premiered at this year's Sundance film festival to immediate acclaim, and Apple+ immediately snapped it up for a Sundance record #25 million. The movie was released on Apple+ and also in select theaters a few weeks ago, and I finally had a chance to see it at my local arthouse theater here in Cincinnati. The Tuesday early evening where I saw this at was not attended well (exactly 5 people, including myself). Regardless, if you are in the mood for a wonderful and moving family comedy-drama, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater (while you still can), on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I've been meaning to see 'CODA' for a while now, but the Best Picture Oscar nomination was what finally got me around to doing so. I suspected I was going to like this movie. This has been the strongest type of movie for quite a few years now. Teenager/s (usually female but not always) dealing with school, family, love etc. Of course 'CODA' has a twist with the deaf family aspect, and this helped it become one of the best films in recent times in a genre that was already extremely strong.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is superb. Troy Kotsur received a Best Supporting Actor nomination - and deservedly so - but I feel like Marlee Matlin could easily have earned one as well. Both are absolutely terrific. Also Emilia Jones plays a crucial role in this film being as good as it is. She has to be extremely likeable, believable in terms of her sign language and also musically talented. Don't underestimate just how good she was.<br/><br/>I've always said the one thing no film can do without is likeable characters and this movie has them in spades. The character of 'Bernardo' played by Eugenio Derbez is a perfect example of this. This is not an easy character to perfect. The hard-ass teacher (with a heart of gold) doesn't just write itself. It has to be carefully crafted to find the perfect balance. They nailed it here.<br/><br/>There are some genuinely funny moments in this film. I'm talking laugh out loud funny. And it really does just come from the characters being themselves. It doesn't feel forced.<br/><br/>My only gripe with the film would be that sometimes the conflict/drama comes from Ruby's parents doing some pretty unkind things to her. It's not just embarrassment at their situation of being deaf which they can't help, it's embarrassment at them doing brutal things to her that any parents could do to their child if they felt like it. It's a small gripe but it did bother me a little.<br/><br/>Otherwise though I had a very good time with 'CODA'. I'm glad this is getting the recognition it deserves and hopefully it helps to continue this genre of film churning out quality products in the future. 9/10.</div>\n",

Her teacher realises her great singing gift and supports her, but she cannot abandon her totally deaf family for whom she acts as full time translator, particular as their fishing business appears to be going under.<br/><br/>One of those truly charming, beautifully acted films that leaves you wanting more. It's largely free of sentimentality, produces some great laughs and is gloriously acted by Jones, her family, all played by deaf actors and Eugenio Derbez as her grumpy heart of gold teacher. It offers great insights into the problems of being deaf in a modern world and the impossible position Ruby is in in having to chose between 2 great loves. The music here is lovely - Jones can really sing - apart from it all seemingly being tied up rather too neatly at the end, it is one of the funnest, most moving films of the year that could easily have been spoiled with too much treacle.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">While the film leans a little too heavily into the (inaccurate) trope of Deaf people not understanding music how its story is executed with grace and humor results in a moving wonderful film. This is a universal story of a young woman learning to develop her own passions and chart her own course. It is also the story of family meeting the challenges of the world head on and how that can impact interpersonal relationships. It is *not* a film about how Deaf people are just so helpless or disadvantaged by society. This is a flesh and blood family-they fight, they deal with sexuality, they deal with friendships.<br/><br/>The cast is the best feature; I would be hard pressed who gave the best performance. Every character is brought to life in naturalistic unstated performances. But I think Kotsur is given the two hardest scenes-dramatizing how a dad comes to indirectly see his daughter's talents-and he rises to the challenge. Kotsur does give my favorite performance of the year.<br/><br/>The other great feature of the film is simple elegant shooting style it has. This film isn't flashy at all but it is so well calibrated that the humor blends seamlessly with the pathos. This could have been coy or excessively sentiment; instead Heder hits each beat and moment just right to bring the Rossi family to life.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">\"Kingsman: The Secret Service\" is a very good film....exciting and heart-pounding throughout. However, it has a couple problems and you might want to think twice before watching it or letting your kids watch it.<br/><br/>The story is very much a reworking of the Jame Bond films...with a few major differences. Instead of one incredibly super agent working for the British secret service, this film is about an organization of men working for the British government as super spies. So, if they want to concentrate on different agents in upcoming films (such as in the third film), they can since it's not just about one guy. Also, while the agents are very sophisticated like Bond, they are more killing machines....with MASSIVE amounts of blood and gore. Oddly, Bond killed folks, mostly as a group in some exploding lair, but there was no blood and not nearly as much violence as you'd assume you'd see.<br/><br/>There are two main plots for this secret organization. The first one involves the recruitment of a new agent, Eggsy (Taron Egerton). Much of the movie concentrates on his training and, ultimately, his first mission. To me, this was the most interesting part of the movie. This leads to the mission...the second plot. A billionaire maniac, Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) is planning something bloody and evil....and very genocidal. And, naturally, it's up to the two new recruits to go into action.<br/><br/>For the most part, I really liked the film aside from the incredible violence. It was smart, well written and well acted. But one scene really left me a bit turned off. Eggy's protégé (Colin Firth) is in a church in Kentucky when suddenly it turns into a giant bloodbath and everyone is killed but this agent. What bothered me is that I think this scene was meant to celebrate this mass killing, as the church members were all extremists....ultra-right wingers who were filled with hate and prejudices. It made me uncomfortable that the film seemed to minimize the deaths of these idiots...idiots but human beings. Don't get me wrong, the deaths of many people wasn't necessarily the problem...as in the end something similar happens. Why is the later kill-fest not the same? Well those later killed were all involved in committing mass genocide. Is being politically incorrect (and a bunch of jerks) as bad as those who commit genocide? And, should we enjoy seeing people we dislike killed like this?<br/><br/>Overall, a film I generally liked but one that you never should let kids watch or anyone who cannot handle the gore. Also, you may find yourself uncomfortable with that church murder scene. If it had been in an abortion clinic or meeting of any left-wing group, it would have been equally repellent to me...though from what I noticed in other reviews, it didn't bother a lot of the viewers.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Having really enjoyed/loved 'X Men: First Class' and 'Kick Ass' and being someone who likes a lot of the actors, 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' did seem really intriguing.<br/><br/>There was the intrepidation of whether it would balance the violence and humour well, whether the violence would feel too much or whether the humour would leave a bad taste in the mouth. Finally watching it, 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' was surprisingly brilliant. It sends up the spy genre (primarily James Bond), very like 'Kick Ass did with comic books, and does so brilliantly.<br/><br/>'Kingsman: The Secret Service' is stylishly and audaciously made, with slick visual effects, very imaginative camera work and editing in the action scenes that gives the film an almost operatic grandeur (like in the fight scene in the church), very cool gadgets, richly coloured lighting and audacious production design. The soundtrack is very groovy and catchy, but is careful not to be overbearing, it is far from one-note too and fits with everything going on very well.<br/><br/>Vaughn does a fine job directing here. Not just achieving the right balance of humour and violence (injecting much needed fun into a genre that has become increasingly serious over the years) and keeping the story absorbing and the characters interesting, but standing out in particular were how he properly allows the audience to properly take in what is happening in the action, without jumping around incoherently or being static, and the huge amount of work that he even puts into the little things like with the opening credits.<br/><br/>The film's script is deliciously irreverent, sometimes raunchy, unrelentingly vulgar and very witty, with a plethora of laugh-out-loud funny to hilarious moments. While the action is grim and unflinching (some of it is not for the faintest of hearts) but nail-biting and surprisingly dynamic, the fight scene in the church especially standing out. The story is very clever and absorbing, with incredibly energetic pacing without being too hectic or rushed. The film does deal with the twist well, it could easily have been out-of-place, clichéd or overly silly but it's actually a lot of fun with a touch of humanity injected.<br/><br/>'Kingsman: The Secret Service' contains some very memorable characters, including a hench-woman with legs that can kill. It's very well acted too, three of the standouts being Colin Firth, cast against type but doing a phenomenal job (also doing incredibly well in the action), Taron Egerton as an immensely likable main lead and Samuel L. Jackson (though his performance has divided reviewers it seems and understandably), who is clearly having the time of his life as lisping megalomaniac villain Valentine. That is not to dispute Michael Caine, who is more than dependable as a somewhat ambiguous sort of character, and Mark Strong who has a knack of making even weak material interesting, or Sophie Cookson, very fetching though in a slightly underwritten role, and Sofia Boutella who nobody wants to mess with.<br/><br/>If there is something that lets 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' down it is the ending with the anal sex. This was the one part of the film that to me came over as really unnecessary and tasteless, also seeming very out of place compared to the rest of the material and it is introduced randomly. The infamous Princess line is pretty offensively perverse as well.<br/><br/>All in all, though, a surprisingly brilliant send up that does nearly everything right. 9/10 Bethany Cox</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE is very much a kindred spirit to KICK-ASS, doing for the spy genre what KICK-ASS did for comic books. It's a light and breezy affair, a film which never takes itself too seriously, involving British spies battling a megalomaniac bent on world domination. Taron Egerton suffers from being an unlikeably 'street' character for a lot of the running time, and some of the humour is a little crude for my tastes, but otherwise this is a film which hits the ground running with a heady mix of comedy, action, and genre tropes.<br/><br/>The story is ludicrous and a deliberate throwback to '60s cinema. Samuel L. Jackson hams it up a storm as the baddie while it's fun to see Colin Firth playing something other than the slightly stuff romantic figure he always reverts to. Where KINGSMAN excels is in the violent action scenes, which play up brief snippets of outrageousness and feature far better choreography than expected. The church fight is the undoubted highlight, but the large-scale action of the climax is well staged too. CGI is used extensively, but works for the most part. I may not be running out to see the sequel anytime soon, but I'll definitely give it a watch at some point.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Kingsman wants to be a lot of things. A James Bond homage mixed with The New Avengers and a touch of The Man from Uncle. Lets throw in Eastenders as well with scenes set in a council estate pub. Taron Egerton plays the young hero Eggsy and Samantha Janus plays his mum.<br/><br/>Kingsman is an independent spy agency with an Arthurian leaning which operates out of a gentleman's tailor shop. When one of the agent dies on duty, Colin Firth nominates a small time criminal (Eggsy) to be a replacement. Eggsy's father was also a Kingsman once.<br/><br/>All the nominees go through a tough selection process. At the same time the organisation investigates the mysterious disappearance of some celebrities and the actions of a well known philanthropist and cyber billionaire Valentine played by Samuel L Jackson who is concerned about climate change and wants to give away free sims, free phone calls and internet.<br/><br/>Valentine obviously watched that episode of Doctor Who where the dastardly villain used mobile phones devices to control people's emotions.<br/><br/>Director Matthew Vaughn as with the Kick Ass films uses strong humour and cartoon violence although in this film, the violence has a video game footage look about it. I do think an anal sex gag at the end was misplaced!<br/><br/>The film is entertaining enough, makes you laugh a few times but lacks a lot of originality. Maybe the comic book it is based on is itself been inspired by many other film and TV sources.<br/><br/>In short its a fan-boy remake of a James Bond film from the Roger Moore era. However hearing Samuel Jackson describing spies and megalomaniacs also reminded me of the film Unbreakable which itself was about people with superpowers and super-villains and Jackson had a major role in that film as well.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">The agent Harry \"Galahad\" Hart (Colin Firth) from the Kingsman Secret Service helps the troublemaker Gary \"Eggsy\" Unwin (Taron Egerton), who is the son of an agent that saved the lives of Harry and his team sacrificing himself seventeen years ago. Harry invites Eggsy to be candidate to the vacancy of a new agent in the agency and he is trained by Agent Merlin (Mark Strong) and competes with other candidates. Meanwhile, the Kingsmen investigate the industrialist Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson), who is an insane genius of technology that is plotting a deadly plan with his assistant Gazelle (Sofia Boutella) to save Earth from global warming eliminating most of the population with a chip and saving only those that he has chosen. <br/><br/>\"Kingsman: The Secret Service\" is a funny entertainment with a violent story of a secret service agency in London. The plot is a sort of parody to the James Bond movies in a Quentin Tarantino style. Colin Firth is hilarious but Samuel L. Jackson is annoying with the weird whisper in the way of speaking. There is a funny scene in the credits that shall not be missed. My vote is seven.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): \"Kingsman: Serviço Secreto\" (\"Kingsman: Secret Service\")</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I had only vaguely heard things about this film when I sat to watch it and, being honest, I was of the mind that it was more aimed at younger audiences. My basis for this was that it seemed like a spy spoof with gentle humor from the brief clip I had seen. Of course very early in the film the action and language let me know this is not the case at all. From this point on we have the standard structure of the new recruit providing the narrative and also acting as the viewer's eyes as he too is introduced to the world of the secret agency. This leads into a fight to stop a typically crazy plan for world domination, and as a plot I found it perfectly enjoyable.<br/><br/>In the specifics though the film is oddly unbalanced in terms of its tone; there is an element of it trying to do that same balancing act that Kickass did, but here it does not come over so well. In some cases it is quite silly and plays to its comedic nature, but then in other ways it is very intense and dramatic with no laughs to be hand. Mostly it must be said, the film does manage to get the silliness and the violence to go together hand in hand, generally with comedic or stylistic flourishes that stop us taking it too seriously – or by killing baddies so the viewer has no moral qualms about any of it. There are examples of the opposite though, and for me the most obvious is the church scene, where we have the mass murder of civilians during a church service. The film tries to make sure the audience is prepared to go with it, by making sure we see this church being a rather vile affair preaching hatred of minorities, however it is really not enough. The scene is delivered with slick style, and an upbeat soundtrack, and feels like it should be fun – but the actual content (and my feeling on it) says that it should be horrific – because it certainly is horrific to watch. It didn't help that the US had a massive shooting a few days before I watched this (although statistically, that is never not going to be the case), but the murder of civilians in a church felt horrible (regardless of the brief highlighting of their abhorrent politics), and to have it played out in an entertaining way just did not work – it felt tone deaf, like the Kickass concept was imported but not testing to see if it fitted. This was followed by a scene of one specific violent act which was actually really well done in terms of the impact on Harry emotionally and physically – it is a great twist and an impacting moment, but like the massacre, it just didn't feel like it belonged in this film. There are other examples of this messy design, and of course the most famous is the anal sex gag right at the end. The internet is full of opinion on that so I'll not add too much; I did understand it was going for a Roger Moore Bond-style sex joke, but it wasn't funny, was delivered in a tone- deaf manner, and again it just felt totally out of place. Otherwise I though excesses like fire- work head explosions actually did work, and married violence and humor well, but the film cannot do this consistently at all.<br/><br/>The cast are good and mostly carry the film through trouble moments even if they too seem to be unsure what type of film they are making at any given moment. Firth is a great lead and plays his part well; even getting a person into the cliché. Egerton is pretty good, not least because he makes a likable character out of someone who is mostly either a chav, or a cocky arse – with the remainder of his character covering for this. Jackson is a lot of fun in the villain role, and the supporting cast is well fleshed out with turns from Strong, Davenport, Caine, Boutella, and others.<br/><br/>Generally the film does have enough going for it to make it enjoyable in a darkly violence way; it is well made and has a strong cast. The tone of the film is very uneven though, and there is some very difficult material in here (both violent and comedic) which needed a very good control to make it work – this it doesn't have and as a result it really doesn't work, often really pushing the viewer out of the film by how tone-deaf the delivery of it is. It is worth a look for what it does well, but those weaknesses are much bigger and impacting that they should be.</div>\n",

It utilizes gadgets that one might find in a James Bond Film or even MIB. They are over-the-top as they spoof spy films. When an agent is killed, they seek recruits to replace him. As young adults compete for the honor, Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson with a lisp) conspires to save the world from Global Warming. His side kick is a woman (Sofia Boutella) with knives as lower limbs. Together they spoof the super villains in films. Our group ironically must stop Valentine from saving the world so it can die later.<br/><br/>This was a funny film with plenty of action and exploding heads.

Instead I got a crazy, mad, violent, nutty and over the top film. It has a definite Britishness to it, it's a very smart looking production, very well acted, with some jaw dropping fight scenes, the visuals and production values are extremely high. The fights involving Sofia Boutella were just insane, she's particularly good. Some big casting, Colin Firth as always makes the perfect gentleman. It's Samuel L Jackson I particularly enjoyed, he was just so funny. Lots of violence, which if it's not your thing you should avoid. Overall, slick and very funny.

I'll just say colorful sprinkle, you'll know what I mean, when you see it towards the end of the movie. I thought it was awesome, but I heard people complain about this \"getting out of hand\", being unrealistic/over the top.<br/><br/>But that's it, because while it seems to have both feet firmly on the ground, it's always on some other level \"flying\" around and giving kudos to old spy movies by acknowledging their existence and tweaking, sometimes twisting our expectations. Something that is done very nicely. But the movie is not meant for those easily offended. It has some crude humor and one of the last scenes, will have a couple of people (especially in America) cringe .. more so, than if some violence was involved.<br/><br/>If you can deal with that and don't mind this being \"British\" to a point, but very on the point when it comes to jokes, while not forgetting that there are consequences, you'll enjoy this. After an initial resentment against the young lead here, I grew to really like him. A very good achievement. Also hearing Samuel L. Jackson lisp - just amazing</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I'll have to preface my review with an encouraging opening remark because I enjoyed the movie well enough for what it was. Others on this board seem to be of a general overall opinion that this was a James Bond genre spy film taken to an extreme level with over the top violence and excessively crude language. Oddly enough, I'm OK with all of that. There was a generous heaping of all the non-stop, violent action that one could ask for, even for Tarentino fans.<br/><br/>So here's where my rant come into play. Sorry, but I just can't help myself when the film invites the kind of criticism I'm about to unleash. I have a big problem with liberal hypocrisy, and it's never been more evident than in this picture. We'll start with the major premise of the villain going in, Richard Valentine, portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson. No beef with Jackson here. But his main agenda has to do with solving the world's 'global warming' problem. To be up front about it, I don't believe global warming or climate change is a man made condition based on common sense backed up by eons of history in which the planet has gone through numerous ice ages and come out of them without human intervention.<br/><br/>Valentine's prescription for global warming - wipe out a good portion of humanity who are contributing to it. But, but, but - only those who are not part of the elite class like the folks invited to his massive house party. Which is just about everyone on the planet. See, if liberals and progressives verbalized what they really believe, this would be part of their solution as well. We'll start with those pesky Conservatives and Republicans. They're too much of a problem to debate about this.<br/><br/>Next - gun violence. While the entire liberal propaganda machine tries to control gun ownership, there's apparently no problem with making movies in which one of the film's heroes takes out what, twenty, thirty, heck make it a hundred people in a wild melee at a hate church. By the way, that was an exceptionally well choreographed and edited action sequence, one of the best ever. It'll be hard to top, though we know someone will try.<br/><br/>OK, how about the War on Women. Gee, the Swedish Princess at the end of the story sure knew how to reward her 'savior' Eggsy (Taron Egerton). If you've seen the movie you know what I'm talking about. I'm not squeamish but it's just too distasteful to describe it here.<br/><br/>How about creating conflict? Valentine's hate-gizmo is just an extension of the mindset the current administration perpetrates every day - white vs black, rich vs poor, men vs women (War on Women, remember), old vs young and so on. So it was genuinely stunning to see the picture at least take a swipe at the current POTUS by having his head blown off when Merlin (Mark Strong) tampers with the controls! Folks, I think you better see this picture before the President has a North Korean reaction to it, know what I mean.<br/><br/>So there you pretty much have it. Like I say, aside from my critical analysis, I enjoyed the picture. Biggest surprise was when Valentine blew away Harry (Colin Firth), almost as unexpected as George Clooney whacking Brad Pitt in \"Burn After Reading\". Tarentino would be proud.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Superspy movies are among the most commonly spoofed, but that doesn't weaken \"Kingsman: The Secret Service\". Colin Firth once again gets to play a gentleman, while Samuel L. Jackson's megalomaniac businessman is the neatest character in the movie (and yes, he does use the word that Jackson uses in a number of his movies). And then there's a certain actor known as a certain Jedi. It's clear that they knew exactly what kind of a movie they were making, so they just let it be as outlandish as possible. Not a masterpiece, but funny enough to enjoy.<br/><br/>PS: The song played at the beginning of the movie is Dire Straits' \"Money for Nothing\", which \"Weird Al\" Yankovic spoofed as \"The Beverly Hillbillies\" for \"UHF\".</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Film 2015 with Claudia Winkleman and Danny Leigh described this film as over the top, the clips and trailers I saw certainly looked that way, with good critic reviews as well I was definitely up for it, directed by Matthew Vaughn (Layer Cake, Stardust, Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class). Basically secret agent Harry Hart and \"Galahad\" (Colin Firth) is unable to prevent the death of fellow agent Lee (Jonno Davies), feeling guilty he personally delivers a bravery medal to the agent's widow Michelle Unwin (Samantha Womack) and his young son, Gary \"Eggsy\" Unwin (Alex Nikolov), saying that if they ever need help, they should call the phone number on the back of the medal and deliver a coded message. Seventeen year later, unknown assailants kidnap climate scientist Professor James Arnold (Mark Hamill), they are led by assassin Gazelle (Sofia Boutella), who has bladed prosthetic legs, and her employer, internet billionaire Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson), Hart's compatriot \"Lancelot\" (Jack Davenport) is killed in a failed rescue attempt, as a philanthropist Valentine meets various heads of state and VIPs, some who afterwards go missing, he also announces a giveaway of SIM cards, granting free cellular and Internet access. In London, unemployed young adult \"Eggsy\" (Taron Egerton) lives with his mother, infant half-sister and abusive stepfather Dean (Geoff Bell), despite his intelligence and capability he dropped out of Royal Marines training, he now lives aimlessly, he is arrested for joyriding a stolen car, and he decides to call the number on the medal and utter the code word. Hart releases him from prison, then introduces him to the world of the Kingsmen, a secret intelligence agency for which he works for, and which Eggsy's late father worked for, following Lancelot's death the agency are looking to recruit a new agent, Eggsy agrees to apply, he joins a group of other candidates, including Roxy (Sophie Cookson) who he quickly forms a friendship with, the candidates are overseen by senior Kingsman agent \"Merlin\" (Mark Strong), they will be eliminated one by one until the right person is found. Tests for the candidate include, without their knowledge, their room filling with water until they manage to escape, training a group of puppies, with Eggsy getting a small pug he names \"JB\" (after Jack Bauer from 24), and a jump from a plane where they are told in mid-air that one of them has no parachute, those who open their working chutes early are eliminated. Meanwhile the Kingsmen investigate Valentine and his connection with VIP disappearances, Hart tracks down Arnold to get information, but a chip is implanted in Arnold's head and causes an explosion, killing him and putting Hart into a coma for a short time, when he recovers he poses as a billionaire and meets with Valentine for dinner, it is there that Valentine compares the human race to a virus, with global warming being the fever caused, he intends to do something about the problem before it gets worse. Valentine is found to be a member of an obscure hate group church in Kentucky, there Hart finds him and Gazelle conducting a test, a signal is broadcast to his SIM cards, this causes everyone in the church, including Hart, to become uncontrollably violent, fighting a mass brawl breaks out with the people fighting each other to the death, but Hart comes out as the sole survivor, Eggsy, Merlin and Kingsmen leader \"Arthur\" (Sir Michael Caine) watch the chaos via video link. Hart is approached by Valentine, he explains his plan: the signal will broadcast worldwide, using his satellite network, so the human race will be culled, so the Earth will suffer no further damage, leaving only the select few deemed worthy of life, those who side with Valentine with protective microchips in their heads, with his planned revealed Valentine kills Hart with a bullet to the head. Eggsy failed the final test, refusing to shoot his dog, meaning that Roxy became the new Lancelot, but he returns to Kingsmen headquarters, where he discovers Arthur has a microchip and is his convert, he avoids a kill attempt and kills the leader, so he teams up with Roxy and Merlin to stop Valentine and his scheme. Roxy goes into the stratosphere in a high-altitude balloon vehicle to fire a missile towards Valentine's satellite network, while Eggsy and Merlin assault Valentine's mountain bunker directly, tackling the many armed guards. The signal is transmitted momentarily causing worldwide chaos, but the satellite is knocked out, Eggsy fights his way through the security forces, the security chips are detonated by Merlin, with all the heads of those part of Valentine's plan killed as their heads explode, Gazelle and Eggsy fight until she is defeated, and finally Valentine is killed and the world is saved. In the end Eggsy becomes a full Kingsman, he is able to reach out to his mother and offers her a nicer house and a chance to get away from her abusive partner, but he is willing to fight those who will stop him from doing so. Also starring Edward Holcroft as Charlie, Richard Brake as The Interrogator and Theo Barklem-Biggs as Ryan. Egerton is a great choice as the streetwise young agent to be, Firth is cool as the crisp agent, Jackson has a ball as the lisping megalomaniac who ironically heaves at violence, and supporting cast members Caine and Strong are great as well. The characters are all very good, the agents codenamed after the knights of the Round Table is good, the James Bond style gadgetry is fantastic, the outrageous violence does not disappoint, the moments of comedy are funny, and the fight sequences are well executed, it is a terrific fast-moving spy action thriller. Very good!</div>\n",

When one of their agents, 'Lancelot', is killed in the line of duty each of the others must nominate one person to compete for the position. Harry Hart, code name Galahad, nominates Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin; the son of an agent who died saving Galahad. It soon becomes apparent that most of the other candidates see him as a council estate oik but as the training progresses and others drop out it becomes clear that he might just have what it takes to become a Kingsman. While this is happening the Kingsmen work to uncover what Lancelot was doing when he was killed; signs point to American billionaire Richmond Valentine",
      " who it turns out has a rather drastic plan to solve the problem of over population.<br/><br/>This is clearly trying to be like James Bond turned up to eleven; in some ways it works; in others it doesn't. Colin Firth does a fine job as the suave Galahad; a character that felt like a cross between James Bond and John Steed",
      " but more violent. Taron Egerton does a solid job as Eggsy, Sophie Cookson was good as his friend Roxy and Mark Strong is good as tech-specialist 'Merlin'. As the villain Samuel L. Jackson was rather fun although he was overshadowed by Sofia Boutella who made a great henchwoman; the way she used the swords built into her characters prosthetic legs was certainly memorable. The action was fairly over-the-top in a rather fun way; it is violent though",
      " in an early scene a man is sliced in half vertically; if that doesn't bother you the rest should be okay. Strangely the ending which features many exploding heads eschews gore in favour of a firework like effect that felt a bit too cartoony for my taste. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of the genre; it skilfully manages to walk the fine line between a 'proper' spy movie and a parody",
      " it isn't for the too easily offended though.</div>\n",

However, I did find the villain in the movie was a bit too eccentric to really be taken all that serious, which was a shame because it gave the movie sort of a cheesy comic book quality to it.<br/><br/>The special effects in the movie were great and very convincing. The action sequences were great to look at and nicely choreographed. The gadgets and gizmos were great and very much in tune with movies such as \"James Bond\".<br/><br/>All in all, then \"Kingsman: The Secret Service\" is definitely a movie well worth spending your time money and effort, on especially if you like action spy movies.</div>\n",

It's got suave heroes, unbelievable stunt-laden action, natty high-tech gadgets, a megalomaniacal villain with a cool mountain-top lair, a deadly henchwoman with an unusual pair of weapons, and oodles of extreme violence, all delivered at a cracking pace with stunning visual effects by Kick-Ass director Matthew Vaughn. It also features the best use of Lynyrd Skynrd's Freebird in a movie since The Devil's Rejects (during an incredible fight sequence in a church). A well deserved 9/10.</div>\n",

Is there an edict that all the characters have to use the F-word several times in any conversation? Now I understand the concept of using language that will help make dialog seem realistic, but just like too much pepper will ruin a steak, too much pervasive peppery language can ruin a script. It makes the movie less interesting and less entertaining.<br/><br/>The movie is adapted from the comic book. Young actor Taron Egerton is in the role of Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin who is smart and talented but seemingly wasting his life with petty misbehaviors of various kinds. He is given a chance for redemption when he is among 9 young men and young women to train for a select secret organization. When he is successful he is expected to save the world. <br/><br/>Nothing in this movie is plausible, it is all over-the-top stuff. Samuel Jackson plays an evil guy who is hatching a plot to thin out the world's population. If it had been less \"dirty\" it would have been a much better movie. It also has lots of violence.<br/><br/>DVD from my public library.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Taken from the comic book bt Dave Gibbons and Mark Millar, Kingsmen is all about what it takes to go from a commoner to one of the men on her majesty's secret service. If anything, this is one of the rare comic book movies that improves upon its source material.<br/><br/>Matthew Vaughn (Stardust, Layer Cake, Kick-Ass) does a great job with this film, making a better Bond film than Bond films.<br/><br/>Ever since a tragic mission in 1997, Harry Hart (Colin Firth) has felt like he owed the family of Lee Unwin - who died to save his life - something. He gave the family a number of they ever need him and seventeen years later, Eggsy - Lee's son - calls him. As played by Taron Egerton, he becomes the true hero that the Kingsmen - a secret organization of spies devoted to protecting the United Kingdom - has been looking for.<br/><br/>He must also deal with Richmond Valentine (Samuel Jackson), a rich genius using free wireless to cut down the Earth's population. He's backed up by Gazelle (Sofia Boutella, Atomic Blonde), a killer with prosthetic legs.<br/><br/>Plus, Mark Strong is great as the handler Merlin and Michael Caine can be in as many spy movies as he'd like.<br/><br/>I love that the idea of this movie is pretty much how Terence Young turned Sean Connery into James Bond. Millar said, \"Young realized he had to turn Connery, this rough Edinburgh guy, into a gentleman, and before they started shooting the movie, he took him to his tailor, to his favorite restaurants, and basically taught him how to eat, talk, and dress like a gentleman spy.\"<br/><br/>This movie made me so pleased because someone remembers how to make a Eurospy movie with style while not being overly referential to what came before.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Having just staggered through Sin City: A Dame to Kill For, I perhaps saw \"Kingsman: The Secret Service\" at the wrong time. My sisters especially are big fans of Colin Firth so I rented this.<br/><br/>The story is about a teen from London (Taron Egerton) called \"Eggsy\" who is chosen to interview as a professional spy for a secret group called the Kingsmen. They eliminate applicants during the \"interview\" -- which is actually a series of treacherous attacks, etc. -- until there is one left standing. <br/><br/>\"Kingsman\" is reminiscent of The Avengers on TV and 007. It has some very funny scenes, particularly toward the end, and clever dialogue throughout.<br/><br/>The violence was very cartoon-like, but I still didn't like it and found it too much and too graphic. I admit I'm not a big fan of violence, but I'll put up with it for something like \"The Godfather\" - -- not for this. <br/><br/>Lots of explosions and clever spy devices, with good performances by Colin Firth, Samuel L. Jackson, and Egerton. Look for Mark Hamill -- see if you can find him without knowing which character he plays.</div>\n",

This doesn't and it utterly ridiculous, given the violence factor in the film. The hate meeting at the church with the resulting mass shootings and stabbings by our hero is outrageous.<br/><br/>Samuel L. Jackson, with his typical draw, is the villain here. Hoping to create chaos and killing via a cell phone, the plot is as ridiculous as his idea.<br/><br/>Our hero, coming to the rescue, needed a far better script than what he got. How did his mother, married to the secret agent who is killed at the beginning of this film, ever come off to take a 2nd husband, who was the exact opposite as her hero husband?</div>\n",

I like the characters in the film, I think Colin Firth is very convincing as a gentleman and secret agent.

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">From time to time in these comments, I remark on my surprise at how sophisticated young viewers are, and how they demand ever more complex and subtle self-referential folds. It gives me pleasure to realize that my flower children cohort were and still are largely incapable of this level of abstraction. It gives me hope for the future because introspective abstract reasoning is the central factor in reasoning about the world.<br/><br/>Then again, from time to time, the nearly suicidal revelation appears that these kids have lost much of what we knew, learned at great cost. We knew that governments shouldn't spy and torture; that women deserve level humanity; that death is not comic. We knew that feeding stereotypes, especially those of blacks, can be fun only when we know the game. We knew this, and still do.<br/><br/>I was patient enough with the excess until the church massacre. After all, I liked Kick-ass and Layer Cake. These had a different balance: yes, they were comic-influenced compositions of set pieces; yes they shamelessly exploited stereotypes and had unexpected nonchalant pleasure in the violence. But they placed the audience and filmmaker outside the film.<br/><br/>Here, the opposite is emphasized. This is not Bond or Bourne. No, it is not that kind of movie we are told. It is Bauer, who would shoot the dog after abusing it.<br/><br/>After the church scene, I felt myself tumbling into a dead future. Who would tolerate this? Who would enjoy it?</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">After seeing LAYER CAKE all these years ago I was instantly struck that a new and important director called Matthew Vaughn had arrived on the British film making scene and Vaughn was a name to keep an eye out for , same as Danny Boyle was from a decade earlier. Since then Vaughn hasn't made enough films and the ones he has made are entertaining enough mixing black comedy and violent but live up to the cliché of close but no cigar and KINGSMAN continues the Vaughn resume in the Vaughn style <br/><br/>So what's KINGSMAN about you ask ? How about \"Bond deconstructionist comic book adventure done in a British tongue in cheek style\" ? Maybe not an entirely accurate description but KINGSMAN is a very difficult film to pigeon hole . In feel it's similar in some ways to KICK-ASS but in many ways it isn't similar and I wonder if I mentioned KICK-ASS down to the same production team being responsible for that film ? The story itself revolves a lower working class nobody called Eggsy who lives on a dead end London estate and is recruited by an offshoot of the British secret service to foil the plans of an international villain called Valentine . It's not all that original and the tone of the film isn't entirely successful or consistent but like LAYER CAKE the story itself is a bit of a mess . This is hardly surprising for a film that often veers from meta-fictional Bond or Bourne far fetched globe trotting adventure to a British grief porn kitchen sink drama . What stops it all falling apart is the sense of fun and kinetic energy Vaughn injects in to the film in general and the cast in particular . Any movie that has Firth , Caine and Jackson as the leading lights is worth watching for that reason alone and that trio don't disappoint though Mark Strong's annoying unconvincing Scottish accent is a distraction .<br/><br/>We occasionally hear rumours about a big budget silver screen version of DOCTOR WHO and I wonder if Matthew Vaughn would be the natural choice to direct that quirky , unique and uniquely British show ? And some of the plot turns are so far fetched they wouldn't be out of place in DOCTOR WHO . Colin Firth as The Doctor versus Samuel L Jackson as The Master ! Sign me up for a ticket now , though please no swearing and get Russell T Davies to do the screenplay instead of Jane Goldman Regardless of what Vaughn does in the future he's still a name to keep an eye on and here's hoping he's making films for years to come</div>\n",

The Movie is so Sleek, Stylish, and Outrageous it is likely to Cause Spontaneous Orgasim among Teenagers and Hyper-Actives of all ages.<br/><br/>All the Money spent on this Glorious, Gory, Goof is up there On the Screen. It Razzles and Dazzles in almost Every Scene. The Writing is Smart and Reverentially Reflective as the Tone Fluctuates between Irreverence and Irresponsibility.<br/><br/>But a Good Time can be had by Those Willing to Allow for some Gut-Wrenching Displays of Murderous Mayhem and not so easy to take Comedy, like Our Hero's Reward for Saving the World that Ends this Exhausting Entertainment. That may be the One Time that the Director's usual Disregard for Good Taste got the better of His Trademark Avoidance of Sensibility.<br/><br/>Some May Point to the Church Slaughter as another, but that is Not Meant to be so Personally Invasive, more like a Parody of Hyper-Hypocritical Comeuppance. <br/><br/>Overall, the Movie cannot be denied its Fresh Fervor and Willingness to Step, No Leap, Over the Line of what has Come Before. The Cast is Excellent and the Director Shows No Signs of Losing His Edge.<br/><br/>Recommended for Open Minded Art and Political Satire Lovers. as it Parodies he Real World of Politics, Religion, and Global Disarray Spiraling Out of Control. <br/><br/>Behold...This is Art Imitating Life with a Swagger and a Smirk.</div>\n",

    "In the workshop we have successfully applied the web scraping sentimental analysis methods. In the web scraping process, we have collected the reviews of 6 movies from the IMDB site. To scrap the data from a website we have used BeautifulSoup and requests library. To do the sentimental analysis we have used NLTK library. Using the Tf-idf scheme, the accuracy of SVM model is 0.74 and for Decision tree model is 0.5. while through the BoW scheme, the accuracy of SVM model is 0.87 and for Decision tree model is 0.47. The accuracy of Decision tree model is very low and the reason is data insufficient. The BoW Scheme is performing well in terms of accuracy. "
